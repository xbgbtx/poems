Curse this Black Tongue of Mine

Fragments of dreams dance before me
Slaves marching through the night
I drink petrol and spit at all
Just for the love of a sup.
Curse not my wretched eyes
For they see nothing and I am unknown
Let loose my tattered bowels
I spit forth towards the dawn
Her embrace is all I need
Wicked though my words are
They are not chosen carefully
All hope is lost at night
We pray that evil born here
Shall rest by morning come
