Though at night I can see you twinkling
Through the fog, smoke and smog;
The scattered ashes of our last stand.
In my dreams I can see your face
Howling in agony, crying in pain.
Sometimes I dream that I am not the last
To walk this earth free and unchained.
I donâ€™t dare to ask you here.
The ground is stained with our blood.
All that remains is an empty cage;
Buildings that once reached for the heavens
Only to collapse upon themselves.
And so I wander the barren fields,
Praying that I am not the last
Who could keep their mind free.
I try to believe I am not alone
But my faith has been smashed
Along with my home, my heart.
A cold stove gathers dust.
Gone is the joy of friendship,
Forgotten with our songs of mirth.
