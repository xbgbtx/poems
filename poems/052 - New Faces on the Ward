New Faces on the Ward

Cast aside by another doctor
We find ourselves trapped another day.
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
Another drunk stumbling in?
A COVID patient to cough on us?
Or a towering beast of a child
With no self control
And muscular arms with great reach.
Last night we were as thick as thieves.
Laughing and scheming,
We shared music and poetry.
Those were easier times
When we knew each others signs
And how best to handle ourselves
When we were together.
