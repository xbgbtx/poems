I've got eight fingers on my palms
And two thumbs next to that.
Toes? Well I've got plenty of those!
How many leaves are on each tree?
Well I shall count those as well.
And when autumn comes I'll fear them gone
But after the chill of winter they'll return.
I could count the seasons
But those seem to whirl round and round
So I'll count the stars instead,
Giving a new name to each fresh discovery.
How many days are left on earth?
That is one I may never know.
