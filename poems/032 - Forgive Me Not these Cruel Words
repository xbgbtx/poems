Shattering their electric eye
By staring straight back at it.
Fuck the Brits and all
Who conceived this sickening plan.
To monitor all our comings
And observe all our goings.
They silenced our Irish tongue
In the halls of the Christian Brothers.
Nuns strapping helpless boys
Trying to remember their Rosary's
Along with their maths and physics.
Well Alan Turing is smiling now
For he was the the one they conscripted
To weave their wicked webs.
And though he will never be reborn
I shall forever carry
The flame of the wrath
Of his retribution.
