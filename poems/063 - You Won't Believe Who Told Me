I heard a little bird's singing
So sweet and delicate in the air
She swooped down low
Just to have a peak at me.
Crows they know more than you could think.
They've seen it all and will be first
If there's blood to shed for them to drink.
They don't mind from whose cup it spills.
There's a murder of crows here each night
As I've been sharing my blueberries.
So keen is their ear and wise their sight
That they need not invade a mind.
When respect is earned they pay it back.
Birds love a good tall perch as a vantage point.
They hate to see us suffer
And love to hear us sing.
