A tortured mind reflects its masters.
How foolish do they seem now?
As they grasp at straws.
As we wake each day
So to do the monsters.
They call for our blood.
They want us to kill.
When you find yourself naked,
Drenched in sweat,
Beneath the cold unforgiving stars.
Say only this, "I reject you foul beast."
Howl as only a banshee can,
Claw the eyes from their face.
When you are overcome
And beaten down.
I'll find myself beside you,
Snarling through my cage.
