The Three Sisters: Fortune, Chance and Fate

I heard her calling as I looked out my window,
Peering at the flashing light of Divis Tower.
I knew she was crying but I did not know why.
In my kitchen I could hear another voice,
Far off in the distant future.
The first call spoke no language,
She had been caged and lay shivering.
Her black skin was mottled with burns
And her tongue had been pulled out.
The second sister was on a far off world.
I could not comprehend her struggle.
The second sister I knew was me.
I can struggle in the present
And with courage I can save all three.
