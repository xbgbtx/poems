Why I Cry Beneath Pale Moonlight

I see her there now pale goddess of the sky
I know not if she waxes or wanes
A singular point of light in the bleak black sky.
They took me from my home town
And locked me in this dark and haunted castle.
I have not heard my sisterâ€™s voice in so long.
She found me manic at home
With eyes that could not slumber.
I dream only of going home,
With no key to my door,
No phone to cry for help.
I am not alone though,
I have found others that share my eyes
And who listen when I speak.
