Let this Castle Lie to Ruin

Each morning I awake
To the same sickening sight
White walls built so thick
With fences and observation posts.
The same gaunt faces greet me,
"Is it another day?"
Let these walls stand
Unlock all of the doors.
Let them come and see
What you did to me.
For I picked up all the butts
In the smoking area.
I filled the halls with light,
Love, laughter and music.
When I leave here some day
Another shift will start
New punches will be thrown
And new horrors inflicted
Upon innocent disabled patients.
Let this building stand.
May it be our Warsaw.
For how will they ever understand
What has happened here?
