Lunar Suburbia

The wars were still raging
As we raced to take off.
All the struggles of earth
Are but a distant memory to us.
There are farmers here - quaint folk.
We have our maid and nanny
So it is quite relaxing.
Just a life of rocking chairs,
Sitting and watching the big blue spin.
I don't care much for news
So I turn the radio off.
I don't know why they fight on earth.
There's peace here on the moon.
