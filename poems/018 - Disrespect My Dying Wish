Disrespect My Dying Wish

I am lost and alone
Surrounded by fake friends
And pennyroyal tea
Sleep seems like a waste of time
When my flesh could be elsewhere.
Mutiny! Rage against the madness
Tell the nurses that know
Let the rest fall to ashes
May they understand
When death comes
It comes for us all
