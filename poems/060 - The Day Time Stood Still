The Day Time Stood Still

It seemed like millennia had passed
That morning when I awoke.
In a room with no clocks
I fumbled for my glasses.
Time had no more meaning
And gravity just pulled me
To stand own my own two feet.
How long I paced to and fro.
I just had to try and find the words.
Old puzzles and games ran through my mind.
The contrast between a maze and a labrynth.
That narrow gap between hospital and jail.
The whole world is a cell
Until we all stand and realise
That one day we will all die.
Tomorrow's future seems so certain
But in fifty years who knows?
War, famine and pestilence drive us still.
The poets have not all gone mad
But we are cursed to fall as well.
My words spiral into an empty void
Meaningless and useless.
One day the sun will explode
And we will be long gone.
