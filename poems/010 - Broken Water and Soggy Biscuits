Broken Water and Soggy Biscuits

The Queen came for tea today
Pity we slipped her something funny.
Poor Lizzy is spinning dizzy
And I can’t smell my own arse
Well it’s a fool’s fortune they seek.
We wear our gold proud
Knowing we can melt it down
When the time comes
For computer gravy and microchips
