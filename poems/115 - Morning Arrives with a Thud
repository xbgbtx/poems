Morning Arrives with a Thud

Something's banging on my door,
Announcing morning with a thud.
My head it's still foggy
From the sleeping tablets I ate.
Cigarettes is what they usually want.
It's like smoking on the playground.
The smokes are made of cancer
So just let them have it.
I pray it's not another chancer
Banging on my door today.
