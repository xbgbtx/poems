How many days will these white walls stand?
What would we even do with the bricks?
Where did the lovely sunshine go?
Or the wind across our face?
I fear there is nothing now.
No replies to my posts.
So I am alone and suffering
Together with the other patients.
How we drive each other mad.
There's no escaping this,
There is nowhere to run.
Hide if you like
But one day you'll find yourself
Surrounded by walls
Alone.
