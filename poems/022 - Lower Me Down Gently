Lower Me Down Gently

A wake in a grand house with plenty of craic
Who is seeing who and what do you do
I scrubbed tea cups all day
Just to find something to do.
By the wee hours when the drunks left
She sat in her grand living room
Clutching one last cup of tea.
Hoarsely she kept repeating tales of him
How proud and noble he had been
I couldn’t stand the sight of such grief.
When morning came we put on our best
Clothes kept clean for special occasions.
Innocently the children played on the staircase
Not knowing just what had left.
We marched behind the coffin
The whole road diverted.
After a quick repetition of mass,
The usual peace and love bullshit,
I found myself volunteered to hold the ropes -
Something I didn’t know I had the strength for.
So when the last word was said we lowered him down
And tried to say farewell.
