While halls whirling in a daze
Spinning with anger,
Her deafening howl echoing
Down gloomy white halls.
She ranted and raged all night.
She would slap the smart look from the nurse
But that would bring her somewhere worse.
Another empty hall with gloomy faces.
One colouring a picture
The other ranting about something in the Bible.
What does it matter anyway?
Our looks will fade
And our hearts will cease.
To be surrounded by loved ones
Would bring some relief
But there's not much time for that here
In the white halls where all Poets meet.
