When I'm Soaking Wet

If I'm soaking wet
I might be singing in the shower
But I'll never forget
All the terrible things I have seen
And when the rain has washed me clean.
So don't assume I'm happy now
When it hurts it leaves a scar
I'm so cold I'll never let my guard down
In case the castle tumbles as well.
So don't look me in the eye
If you're not here to help
Because I'll meet your lying gaze
And any expectations you have of me.
I can soar because I have fallen
I picked myself up from the ground.
I'd love to carry you all
But my pain is not a fiction
And it hurts to hear my voice
Strain against the nightmares
I talk only the truth
And that's why nobody listens.
