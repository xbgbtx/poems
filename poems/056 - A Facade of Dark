Down through the canals of the mind,
Swirling through the gutters of dreams
I dance clothed in iridescent colours.
From all around they come,
From the deserts, mountains and swamps,
To witness the glorious spectacle.
Drinks flow freely,
Libations for the celebration.
We toast and cheer as the gold flows.
Fat swine roll up to pay a visit,
Dazzled by the flowing movements.
No need to mention our terrible curse.
Our fate is to watch it all unfold
And steal ourselves away by dawn.
