Brutal was the fighting this afternoon.
The ground was stained with blood
And the carrion birds circled overhead.
The last Vandal stood surrounded,
Clutching a sword and shield.
"Come take me swine", they shouted,
"I was born and shall die free!"
Without much further ado they were overcome.
The Romans did not take prisoners
But rather dragged them from the city
And crucified them on a hill.
