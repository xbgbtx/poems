Don’t Ruin My Clothes

Four fit policemen and a gander of nurses
Tried to stop me shouting
So I took off my coat
Before they laid their hands on me
I passed the doctor my glasses
“Hold onto these ye donut”
I was prepared for a slaughter
So I riled and I proclaimed
If you’re going to kill me
Please don’t ruin my clothes
It’s a shame to let a stitch go to waste
Some other poor bastard might need the threads
When I am gone from this world
