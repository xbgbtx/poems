Sirens from Beyond the Horizon

Boy! Keep your lust for life
Though dark here it is
Morning is breaking elsewhere
Rats pass squeaks from one cage
To the cell beside them
Meanwhile the guards are at play
Imposing their will upon me
When their turn on watch shifts
They rattle those filthy keys
Writing reports on their behaviour
A clever mouse roams the cages free
Passing the rats screams to birdie tweets
Well the hour is upon us all now
To toil forever in sunshine
While the moonlight gives us rest
All across the world the owl flies
Seeking the words of the very best.
