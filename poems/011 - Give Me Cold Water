Give Me Cold Water

We need to douse the flames
Of what we ourselves started
Such agony burns here now
Nearly buried alive
Some foolish chancers
Have chosen to lose
Well I roll my own cigarettes
And stub them in me own hand
So this is a song
Even an IRA man could understand
It’s too late for you
Sometimes you love
Only to look the other way
Some days you you die
And there’s no coming back
