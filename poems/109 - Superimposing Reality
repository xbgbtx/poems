Superimposing Reality

I was breathless with excitement
The first time I tried one on -
One of those virtual reality headsets.
Immediately I was captivated
For there is a whole new universe here.
By tricking our perceptions we are immersed.
There are many things to do and see,
And even some new friends to meet.
However we only really meet their shadows.
There is nothing natural in this place
Only the figments of our imaginations.
Still I love to dance there
And escape reality for a while.
