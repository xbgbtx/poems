How we toiled in daylight,
Keeping watch for the lions.
Those we kept became kittens,
So soft and adorable.
By night we heard the howling.
We came to fear the moonlight
For she guided the wolves to us.
Every plant we touched became a poison.
Such boils and blisters we suffered
As we shivered through the night,
Praying each vine was not a python.
Along came a madman
Too dangerous to behold.
In his eyes was murder
And none dared speak his name.
Into the caves he lead us
And instructed to keep only
The sharpest stones and
Most balanced branches.
Go now children! He beckoned.
Surrounded by the mushrooms we gathered
He tasted each one.
Sometimes it was a delight
But once it was nearly his death.
For months he suffered in agony
The spark lost from his eyes.
While we wept by the cave
He remained watchful.
While sharpening our spears
He noticed a brief flash on the walls
As though lightning had struck.
