High Friends in Low Places

God how we dread the day
When one of those ambulances comes
To grab us from our home
And under blue lights drive us away.
You never know who'll be there
In hospitals like these.
We're all spinning in our own world
And we bounce off each other.
Like a sea of quarks we collide
Under a doctor's microscope.
Some physics professors call it light
But for me it is only anger.
