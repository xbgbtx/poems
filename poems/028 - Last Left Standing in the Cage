They rounded up seven of us
And herded us into a cage.
And though we were burly boys
A hot poker and some dogs
Could force us in.
A crowd had already gathered
Fueled with whiskey and bloodlust.
An officer went round
Announcing odds and taking bets
So the fight could begin.
I had one eye to start with this time
The other I lost a few nights ago.
Still I was the favourite
So all bets were on me.
I am gaunt yet muscular,
Quick and ruthless.
I have managed to sneak a tip
From a wooden kitchen knife and
Clutched carefully in my palm.
When they unleashed us it was all a daze.
Darkness, carnage, anarchy in that cage.
Next time I looked they all laid dead
And I gazed upon what had happened.
In the pile of steaming meat
Was my old cousin Sean.
