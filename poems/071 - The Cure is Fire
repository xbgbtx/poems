The Cure is Fire

I run towards the liars
Bringing fuel for the fires.
I fight endlessly both day and night.
Just help them if they get near.
I hurt myself
Once in a blinded rage
I learned from that
But I am now encaged.
Go your own way
You can fight alone.
I've tasted blood
And now I want some more.
There's no cure for my fire
My only disease is
An engulfing rage.
I stir up the tension
I spin round the drunks
Feeble blind warriors
Who have lost their way.
Nerves of steel
I will never beg
For help or shelter
I will take anything
I see fit.
There's no cure
No cure for rage
I want more
Bloodshed and carnage.
And when I get home
There I will stay
I'll die to defend it
I only leave to hunt.
So there's no cure
For this beating heart.
I've burned all my whiskey
And torched the whole damn lot
Of sinners who died in my wake.
And when I need rest
I'll just sing a song
And the birds will come to feast.
Feasting alone is an ill kind of feeling
But that's all I have so I'll enjoy it.
I've hunted for love but I found only death
So I'll change up my tactics
And wait for it to knock instead.
