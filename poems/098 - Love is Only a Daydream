Love is Only a Daydream

I see you there so beautiful
I think of you as something I could have
And hold in the darkness.
Unfortunately that is not our fate
For an artist can never find love.
We can see the hourglass of earth
The inevitable pull to oblivion.
We must work ourselves to the bone
To rage against the evil.
There could be love in the afterlife
But for now it is certain
There is not enough time for love on earth.
