Can't Take the Moon from my Night

Even if you leave me cold outside
You can't take the moon from my night.
Though the stars are so dim
Against your endless electric din
Our moon she shines so bright.
Nothing you ever do
Will take the beat away from my heart
I'll fight you till I die
You can't take the light from my sky.
