Retribution for a Mind in Flames

They cannot steal my eyes
For though I mistook their walls
For a quaint house of brick
Something to call a home
It was but another cage
Each night the flickering television
Leaked out more and more
Their filthy words shattered my mind
And thrice I picked up the pieces
“Don’t end up like me dear daughter”
Locked away in some unknown tomb
Sending postcards to an empty cradle
Tonight I will be divine
And fury shall be my call.
