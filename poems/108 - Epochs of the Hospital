Please cover these blank white walls
With colourful Penrose tiles.
I have met another like me
Who can see how the universe works.
Entry to the hospital is terrifying
So I tried to be someone he could trust.
Now he hears me say that I
Have seen the same colourful visions
Images showing the universe cooling
Only to be reborn in another big bang.
Now there is physics to show
We might someday be reborn.
