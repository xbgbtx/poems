A Mother’s Doubt

All night long I begged of you
Do not send me to hospital
Where the vultures prey
Sick minds bring poison
Each shared word a flashpoint
I would have accepted
Being chained in the floor at home
But instead I am at the threshold
Of prison or murder.
One wrong move by me is death
A thousand of the staff’s missteps
Go forever ignored
So bright by day I am
Followed by gaunt disgusting ghouls
I know not when I will find home
They trick me with a sedated tea
To spin into insanity
One wrong for me and I will be judged
By the corrupted court of the queen
I can barely survive where I am
And they lead me to a fresh bed
In some other hell.
