I know the delight of a child
Learning everything for the first time.
In my mind I am childish still.
I gaze on all creation with wonder
And I do not know from where evil comes.
I think there are too many of us now.
We haven't got enough to eat or drink.
So give me an exiled child
And I will raise them
To have courage, might and wit
