The Way of the Opposing Fist

Some call it 'jeet kune do'
It was known by one man
He would stand alone
And face an entire crowd
Of mobsters, cheaters and monsters.
Carefully he would lay his traps
Always fighting to defend.
But he was a mortal man
And was flawed like us all.
Still none dared to oppose him
When he had only his bare hands.
