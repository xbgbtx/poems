Seeing the Stars by Day

At night they seem so far
That we can barely see them
We wish to reach out and touch
To have and to hold them.
By day there is nothing
But that cold blue sky.
But we can see the stars by day
We need only look at our sun,
The beautiful mother of our earth.
Sometimes we see the moon up there
Her fragile white in the day's sky.
We wait for an eclipse
So we can all feel that darkness
That moment of eerie solitude.
