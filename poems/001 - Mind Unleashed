See these chains broken upon the floor
My mind flayed by your eyes no more
Scattered words throughout the universe
Lead me no longer astray
I have read and reflected
Seeing only beauty
Deafening with its curse
Poisoned words from tortured minds
Today I drink from a paper cup
The water passes through
Though the bile lingers on
And I know what could be worse
For my words to fall on silenced ears
Who scream upon tasting my mind
Those eyes can see me now
And shall all go insane
When the earth spins to night
I pray a mourning reader
Finds some courage
From my blackened tongue.
