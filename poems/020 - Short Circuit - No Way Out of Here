Short Circuit - No Way Out of Here

The guards lie, I am told
The nurses only want the best
Rare curses are sounded
Reverberating down dimly lit halls
The Queen she is at slumber
While the Jack can barely stand
Eyeballs standing on stalks
I heard her say “Traitor!”
For we laid down arms in Ireland
And it was a difficult peace we won
Yet others still lift their rifles
And spill blood in our name.
