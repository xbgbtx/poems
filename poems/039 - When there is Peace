A voice from the East
Whispers in my ear
When I am crying.
They tell me they have eternal life.
Robotics that can replace
Our rotten corpses
While still retaining our soul.
Such beautiful engineering
Would be wasted on a warring world.
Until the last cage is unbolted
They will keep the secret.
For they know our lustful eyes.
We would invade and take it
For ourselves alone.
