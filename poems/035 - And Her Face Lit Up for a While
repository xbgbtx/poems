And Her Face Lit Up for a While

The creature with the dazzling hair,
Spinning and whirling to and fro.
She knew the devil in its eye.
Carefully it treaded between worn out soldiers
And drunkards in a spin.
Cups she laid out for each
Just to come and have a sit.
But we were busy then with our schemes.
It was a sight to behold
So strong and chaotic
Always rattling the cage.
Sweet music it played
Just from its unknown mind.
For a while she knew her youth
And was intoxicated by it.
Eventually the laughs gave way
And silence reigned again.
It has been transferred or beaten
Who knows what it had seen.
Such beautiful poetry lay in a drawer unread.
Just another pile of paper
For the shredder.
She sighed for a long time
And paced to and fro.
Where will they take her
When she can no longer stand?
