Surely when I flush my toilet
The pipes carry the filth somewhere.
Someone else's job to sort it,
To stand waist high in muck.
Where do my dreams go when I awake?
They seem to just drift away
Faint memories rising to the heavens.
Where does the past go when it is now?
We find ourselves immersed in problems.
Cold stone of jails and wine that has lost its sweet taste.
Our past seems to surround and haunt us all.
The past is nothing but a ghost
Rattling its chains to scare the living.
The only thing that can ever remain
Is this present moment now.
