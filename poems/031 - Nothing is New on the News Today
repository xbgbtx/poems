Poor Alice is in chains
And Kurt blew his head off.
Freddie Mercury sings no more
And Diana is not getting a taxi home.
Nothing will ever come back.
Dew drops form on an empty field
While chainsaws rip through the Amazon.
Royal bloodlines still survive
Blood test evidence is provided
Along with the occasional holiday snap.
Young Ginger wouldn't know her mother
It has been decades since she went missing
And was found in an orphanage.
