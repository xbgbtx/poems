They don't have devil tongues
But I can know their mind
They bite and gnash their teeth
Against the cold hard leash.
They don't see beauty in the sky
Only opportunity
They hide by day covering their tracks
Waiting for a full moon
When they can see our trails.
They will sniff us out
And stalk shadows near our caves.
All they really want is to hunt
And our two hands is all we have
To beat them off or carve a spear
For we are the ones who master fear.
So timid are they now
Simple minded little dogs
But that is not our sin
They came to us for blood
And submitted to us their lives
And their lineage.
So lassie roll over now
We will never let you go.
