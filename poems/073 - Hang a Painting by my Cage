Hang a Painting by my Cage

So it seems I'm going nowhere still...
I feel like there is nowhere to go anyway.
So here I am where I always stand
Alone on my own two feet.
I pace around lost on foot
My feet can move
But they can't set me free.
That's a privilege for the Doctor
And I don't speak their language.
Such cruel analytical minds
Can't appreciate the beauty of fire,
Of flickering lights
Dancing across the wall of a cave.
So hang a painting in my cage
I would love something to look at
Apart from blank white walls.
