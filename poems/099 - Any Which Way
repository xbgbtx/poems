Any which way you go
You will meet these eyes.
Those that have seen enough
To put it all together.
Those who reject the evil
Of intoxication
Whether through whiskey
Or the love of themselves
Or someone else.
The secret is as plain as decay
We are dying each day.
So measure each breath you take
For you must use it to fight.
