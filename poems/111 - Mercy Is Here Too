Mercy Is Here Too

Though it is indeed dark
Inside these hospital walls
There is mercy here as well.
Nurses, stressed though they are,
Will find the time to have a chat
And do their best to help you out.
Mercy is the most beautiful thing
To flow through this ward.
It is the major reason
That we patients survive.
