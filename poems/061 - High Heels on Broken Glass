The wretched they are warring
While the beautiful continue to dance.
They broke through our perimeter
And set fire to our homes.
But she still goes out each night
To dance in the remaining bars.
A fair nights wages she makes
Courting drunken officers.
She has no children of her own
But she passes along some coins
So that single mothers can survive
And feed their starving children.
When the night is done
She wraps herself in her coat
And marches home through twilight.
