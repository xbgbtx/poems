Bet on the Horse with No Name

Jockeys prepare thy whip
For there's a horse with no name
Riding free today.
The rich shuffle along
In their finest clothes
To the biggest race of the year.
The Grand National they call it -
A fine occasion for champagne.
It's the horses who are in pain
Riding as fast as they can,
Falling with broken legs.
Pray for the horse with no name
Or your name will be on one of the stallions
And your bloodline will be forever
Run ragged along the course.
Bet all your money,
Add a little testosterone to the feed
So that your little steed
Will be able to walk
When the race is run.
