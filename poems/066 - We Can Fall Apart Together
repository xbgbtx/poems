In madness oh I dared to question time.
The fruits of my labour never seemed mine.
I delved deep into the mirror
Only seeing my reflection.
I knew two eyes could see two hands
And I questioned the shadows on the wall.
All this for nothing it seems
Since my body will one day decay.
As will all things around us.
But like autumn leaves that fall
Dreams return to the earth
And feed new tree canopies
So that the mottled light may dance
Forever on the forest floor.
