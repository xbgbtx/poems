When my Pen Runs Dry

All these things I write
I don't stop to think
I just scrawl them out
As fast as my hand can go.
I don't care for rhyme
I can't count a beat
But every word I write
Is true to me, I think.
So when my pen runs out of ink
I'll just get another somehow
It is such a joy to write
And it's so exciting to dream
That someone might be reading this.
