Teeth Gnashing Through The Night

Fools! Stare through my eyes.
Hoping that I shall lead them
Until tomorrowâ€™s dawn.
I have heard the banshees scream.
As they unleash the hounds.
They know not who holds the leash.
They hold the keys to everything
But I see them here no more.
Muttering under my breath
I curse your foul eyes.
Worship me weak minds.
Walk as though you are free.
When the morning comes
Over a distant horizon
I will be here.
Exactly where I stand.
