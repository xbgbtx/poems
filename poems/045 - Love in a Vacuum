Love in a Vacuum

Before all was nothing they say.
But how could love arise from emptyness?
Love has been here all along
Just the love of the universe for herself.
Lonely love would never do.
So love it dreamed of two.
Two bodies caressing in the dark.
And from their passion came the stars
To be scattered in chaos
Throughout the night
