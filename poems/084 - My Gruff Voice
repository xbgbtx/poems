If you heard my gruff voice
Would you hide yourself away?
I am the Hound of Ulster,
An ancient fairy tale.
I shout, roar and command
So much my voice has grown hoarse.
A cigarette calms me now
But I always leave them behind
When I am free of this cell.
I smell of battle now
My body is covered in bruises.
My face is always gaunt and strained
And the light stings my eyes.
In morning I hope to find peace
But each day is another fight.
I shower when there's quiet
And return to an empty bed.
