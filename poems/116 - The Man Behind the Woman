The Man Behind the Woman

So brilliant she was
In that iridescent gown.
Dressed up for the night,
She was happy to celebrate
Their combined success.
An old letch sat at the table
Just waiting for his moment.
The drinks flowed with joy
Everyone at the table cheered.
When it came time to depart
She had to choose a taxi,
A lift in one of the drunkards carriages.
This could be the last night she shines
If that horrible old man
Gets his way with her.
