I'll always remember my youth
When everything seemed lucious,
Sweet and bathed in golden light.
As time passed I had problems
That distracted me from a simple truth.
There's not enough food and water.
Our ecosystem is on the brink of collapse.
When the water wars spread out of Africa
May God have mercy on our souls.
