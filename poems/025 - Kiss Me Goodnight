As we share our final breath
Clutch a dagger by your side
For if the fire were to die
I would drink your blood.
For warmth I would wear your skin,
For food - I don't know what I would do.
I will follow the starlight
Through the decayed ruins
Of madness and despair
And hope to find new light
Over the horizon.
