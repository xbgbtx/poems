Slimy trails over our breakfast
Was the final straw.
At night in the kitchen
We saw them on the wall.
How could so many be here?
I was ruthless and cruel
And part of me regrets it.
For I took the little creatures
And flung them down the alley.
A moment's silence until a splat
And I couldn't help but laugh.
I placed salt by their tunnel
And thought of them no more.
For when a slug crawls
Into my castle's pantry
They do not crawl back out again.
