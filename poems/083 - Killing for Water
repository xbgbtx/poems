Killing for Water

She saw me riding out
With a mad look in my eyes.
I enjoy this hunt
But I'm not killing for pleasure.
I'm not an animal killing animals.
I am a human - I am a master.
Though willingly I slaughter
It is not for love or glory
I give my life because I must.
They have poisoned our well
So I must claim another.
We'll slaughter their village
For they left us thirsty.
I'll slake my thirst with their blood
And ride home to fetch a jug.
