Disgusting wretch thinks he can diagnose
The conditions for my rage
He can only cover his ears while I cry
Bitter, he gives me pills to swallow
Always a different name and always
Ten shapes and different colours.
When the reaper man is done
Will this doctor be the one
To sow new seeds
In the field of dreams
