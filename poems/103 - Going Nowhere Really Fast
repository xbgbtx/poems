Going Nowhere Really Fast

Aliens!
They're in my brain!
Time is moving too slow
Something's wrong!
It's not the mirror.
I'll put the television on.
A broadcast made for me!
Of course!
They're all in league together
They're out to get me.
It's the fillings in my teeth
Or the glasses on my head.
They won't take me this time
I will resist them til the end.
I'll decipher their secrets
The chess, checkers and Jumanji
They've laid it out for me.
There's no time now
Nothing but to fight for the present.
So I'll take their medicine
And enter the cage
But they'll never take my mind again.
