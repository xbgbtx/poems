When the last stone has fallen
Humanity will be gone.
All hopes, dreams, prayers forgotten.
Some repugnant creature will rise
Feeding on our scattered ashes.
Such strange things they will find.
Noisy boxes flashing in empty chambers,
The lights still on as abandoned windmills
Churn ever on.
Where did these strange creations come from?
Who were these five fingered ancestors?
So brilliant and bold.
What could they see?
Beyond the glittering smoggy blackness
That shrouds this forsaken planet.
