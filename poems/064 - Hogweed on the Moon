Hogweed on the Moon

We were careless in our youth.
We loved so much that we danced
Through fields of flowers,
Through the meadows of Ireland
That stand alongside our rolling rivers.
Some of our plants
Are so eager to breed
That their seeds have hooks
That cling to our clothes.
Once it was only nettles here
With their poisoned thorns
But a new plant dominates our banks now.
Hogweed they call it
With its foul lifelong burn.
Let us not be so careless
As to dance on the moon
Before we have finished
Our work here on earth.
