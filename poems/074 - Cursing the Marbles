Cursing the Marbles

My rage will be my grave.
So I stand alone in a hall
Filled with headless statues.
What would they say to me?
Something beautiful I would think.
But instead they stand silent,
Mocking me as my heart pours out
Onto the canvas,
Through a pen
Or through my lonely singing,
Which echoes down the hall.
So curse these wretched statues.
May they fall into the sea
For that is where their silence
Will surely send me.
