A dancer she is fair and gay,
Though the English tongue
Leads her often astray.
Remember those games you played
And those jigs you danced
As one more night of Craic.
Weâ€™ve only the wooden spoons left
For drumming along to the lyre.
Sweet Japanese harpies draw us to ruin
But the gold is in our hands
The beasts wander without chain
The cattle may low and the fox hound growl.
Remember wee Mario when tapping the pipes.
Three taps for a friend - none when silenced.
We snap the lever of empty electric sockets
To remind us of a place half known.
In a dream we have forgotten
All that we were playing for.
