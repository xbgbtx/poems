When I Go From This Place

When they decide I may go
The leaves they'll still grow,
Turn brown and then fall.
December will come
And then whatever next.
The faces I have known
Will frown on their own
And I'll be somewhere called 'home'
But that won't be the end
I'll have grey skies overhead
And I'll stand all alone.
But now I know why I fight
Why I pick up the pen and write
It's for the stars I see at night
And the moon's loving face.
So I'll work by myself
And try to spread joy
Although I know it is hard
To find joy after all I have seen.
