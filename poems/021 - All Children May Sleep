All Children May Sleep

My poisoned brain infects my tongue
Each word sends you spinning drunk
Spin, spin away from me
Drive yourself to crash at night
Blue sirens flash overhead
The news of your death is delayed
Oh God how she wept when she heard
“Don’t wake the children”, she begged.
Her sister offered a pot of stew,
Something to see her through
As the tears flooded down her eyes.
Dawn came with the usual childish squabbles.
Little Jimmy is calling Sarah names
And Michael can’t find his shoes.
“Daddy had an accident” she told them quietly
When they had settled to breakfast.
We’ll go see him in the morning
She prayed to herself - not thinking
Of the unmade bed in their room.
