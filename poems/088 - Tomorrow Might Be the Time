I have said it all last night.
My heart is bare for all to see
It cries for love, for friends and for joy.
But underneath all this pain
There is a small glimmer of hope.
For tomorrow we may sing together
And as one we could all forget time.
I don't really know what tomorrow will bring.
More madness and nightmares?
Or will someone read these words
And raise their voice along with me?
Our problems are war, famine and chaos.
While waiting for tomorrow
Our heart or head could stop,
Our rooftops could collapse.
So hear me this time or the next:
We need to stop hurting ourselves,
We must allow our earth to heal
For we have nothing else.
