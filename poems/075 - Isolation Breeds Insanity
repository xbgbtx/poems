If I could explain all the things I felt
I'd surely write it all down in verse.
For I can feel the suffering here.
It hangs off every face.
I know too well the curse of time.
That we must get old and die
Sometimes before our time.
It's how we treat each other
In these temporary visits
That determines how we feel.
For I could curse my mother
But know that she will return
As always the next day to see me.
But if I were to find love
I know it would be a temporary thing.
Even a lifetime together is not enough.
It could feel like more than a lifetime
If I had to visit a loved one's grave.
