Watching The Darkness

For many it is terror to be alone in the dark.
I have always found it something beautiful to behold.
Our brain fills in the blanks
With its own notion of light.
Colours form and they move around
There's an endless number of colours in the dark.
Sometimes they are vivid and take shape.
Sometimes they are simply dots swirling.
I'm told those are bubbles at the back of the eye
But my imagination fills that void
And all the wonders of creation
Can come to me in a dream.
