Come Stand with the Lonely in Ireland

Though bitter are the lashings
From Her Majesty’s whips
There is a new and joyful Queen in Ireland.
She played with Stoker’s cups.
Ten and one thousand of them fell.
Side by side the pigs danced,
Thinking she was in her grave.
In a wretched hospital she arose
And returned fire to their charges.
Shotguns were raised in her defence.
May they never shoot again.
So bravely they laid her down
Along with a shattered crown.
So come stand with the lonely.
The rest are scattered to the seas.
Please come stand - it is lovely
On Ireland’s fair and verdant ground.
