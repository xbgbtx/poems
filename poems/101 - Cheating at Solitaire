Cheating at Solitaire

Should they be peering through my eyes
Using some hook in my mind
I have laid a simple little trap.
For when I couldn't sleep
I grabbed a deck of cards
And laid them out for solitaire.
A simple game to pass the time
But I had a plan when playing.
I followed the rules until I got stuck
And then flipped over a few extra
For I'd do my best to save the Queens.
So if they were watching they'd surely know
That I cheat when playing solitaire.
So if ever I ask them, "Could you see me there?"
They shall have to reveal their hand.
