Dirty Angels Dropping Breadcrumbs

Angels find themselves in the gutter
With three slices of bread they save one.
Torn up to different sizes,
One to fit each beak.
They know all the bird calls
And where to leave each morsel.
The crows come first
So wink at them with each eye.
Prove you know they see you
And they will trust you a moment
Before they fly away.
Dark though the night seems
There is chittering in the air.
By morning the bread is gone
Without a word of thanks.
Eventually they'll show you
Some of their little tricks.
And the smallest will come visit
Just to hear you sing.
