Couldn't Work My Phone This Morning

Whatever did the doctor give me?
I had a few hours sleep it's true
But I had no dreams as I laid there.
In the morning I awoke
With a groggy head.
Worse than a night on the town
I could barely stagger out of bed.
The buttons on my phone
Seemed out of reach from my thumb.
So if I don't write tomorrow
You can safely assume I'm gone.
