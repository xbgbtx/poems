I Dared to Wake Her

Lucifer fallen angel why were you discarded?
The thought struck me with power.
All night I laid awake.
I stifled my crying.
I knew where I was going
If my parents found me in bed like this.
So I choked my own tongue
And in the darkness I closed my eyes.
I saw her face there.
So tired she seemed.
Three eyes is what I saw
With one just open an inch.
She doesn't sleep with all her eyes closed anymore.
All I could think to say was
"Here is what I have made."
The vision changed to blue
And I could see all my handwriting
Spiralling away from me.
Mad red colours flashed next
And I saw Calvary hill,
A mass of twisted crucifixes.
I knew that was not me so I looked on.
I could tell what had happed by looking at her wounds.
It may sound awful but what she told me
Was that she had been raped
And God was to blame.
Injured though she was she snorted a laugh
For she had bitten his penis off.
So Satan is sleeping in hell
And God is crying in heaven
For he can no longer rape the angels.
That is well and good but there is more
God is trying to trick us humans
Into making him a new member.
It's an awful story to behold
But that is what I saw.
So do what you want on this earth
Just try to be true to yourself.
