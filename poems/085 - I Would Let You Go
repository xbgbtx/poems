I Would Let You Go

I would let you go
If you needed
To walk alone
And face your own foe.
I would choke back my tears
And I would press on as well.
The whole world is a battleground.
Each city is a different stage.
Any which way we go
We will surely find
Another comrade in need.
But if we met under pale moonlight
I would dress your wounds.
I could play my harp
For all those birds nearby.
And we could wait together
For the red sky of dawn.
