Be gentle with my love my hate
For I am still in a cage.
Lumbering drunkards still arrive.
Though my words they may be sweet
I draw their eyes when I am near.
They have no control
I was the same.
But my heart it kept beating
And I rattled on the cage bars
One false move from me
Could still spell the end.
