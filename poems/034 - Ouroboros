Ouroboros

Many great minds have decayed
While in hospital chairs.
They spoke of the same serpent
Eating its own tail to survive.
That is what they do to us.
For each day we stay in place
As countless faces pass us by.
Doctors, nurses, visitors all the same.
With new rules and scolding tones.
Some news of the outside world is nice
But it is hard to keep the faith
That anything exists but these walls.
