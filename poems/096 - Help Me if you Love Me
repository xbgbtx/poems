How could one pen write so much?
Well I held it in my hand.
I was stifling a scream
The entire time.
I hide in my room
And they never knock.
I just want to be alone
But that's not my lot.
So I'll do what I can
With the feeble voice I have
And I'll shout at God
If that's what it takes
To bring this hospital down.
