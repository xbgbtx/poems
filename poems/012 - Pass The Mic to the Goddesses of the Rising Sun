Our time has come
We have failed to maintain
The dim stars above our head
I cry for your help
Stars above Japan
You dream of Heaven here
But it has vanished
Only a candle flickering
In the cold damp wind
Death rides our streets.
Unchained demon of hell
Rise now and strike us down
You give us Saki
We hold our whiskey
Help us ignite our cages
Let them all hang their heads
I pray to the verse ‘Sorai’
I don’t know its meaning
But I feel its flame.
Come now striking goddesses
You have all of their numbers
In their burner phones
Their hushed words
Will never silence
The deafening shriek
Of a wounded phoenix.
