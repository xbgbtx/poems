Disabled is not a Dirty Word

Dear doctor with the baldy head
I doubt there are any brains in there.
I'd slap that smug look from your face
But it would be the gallows for me.
So I say in as polite a voice as I can,
"I am not sick - I am disabled."
Oh how you furrowed your brow.
Well if I could I'd swipe your scalpel
And perform a live lobotomy
The next time you dare to ask
What the fuck is wrong with ME
