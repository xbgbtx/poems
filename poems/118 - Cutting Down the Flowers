Cutting Down the Flowers

See Rose there so tall and proud?
Her beauty is divine
And her mind is sound.
If you spy her in the field
Go ahead and cut her down.
For beauty in your eyes
Is a treacherous thing.
Take her life with you
As another prize.
Just remember her grace
As she withers
Upon your mantle.
