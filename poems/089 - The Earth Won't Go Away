The Earth Won't Go Away

The seas are surely rising
And acid falls from the sky.
We are choking on ashes
Beneath a darkening sky.
No wind not solar will save us.
For there is plastic in all our food.
As we decline madness will take hold.
We will lose ourselves
And be forgotten.
Still the earth will soar
And new creatures will rise.
They will think us peculiar
Having never heard our voice.
