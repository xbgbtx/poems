Countless Unread Tomes

Tonight like every night
May seem special to us all.
But as we drift around
Loving and suffering as we do
The stars drift further apart.
Countless poets died with their words,
Their dreams, their hopes, their scars,
Unread, unheard, ignored.
So to the grave as we all do
Let us walk and try find love
For even one moment.
One moment can last a lifetime
If not an eternity.
