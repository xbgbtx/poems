Lost in a Dream

The maze's walls are ever shifting
And each passage leads to another horror.
I turn when I hear a sweet voice
But there is no going home for me.
The sirens sang and warned me
That I will crash into the rocks
So I steered away from them
And found myself lost.
Follow the walls to the left I thought
And I shall cycle out of this maze
It's an old trick I know from making mazes of my own.
Always turning left leads you in circles
And you visit every room.
Though sometimes it's frightening
A maze is really just a labrynth.
Some build mazes for terror
But they can also delight.
Some labrynths are near me
The beautiful parks of my city.
