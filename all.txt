## Mind Unleashed

See these chains broken upon the floor

My mind flayed by your eyes no more

Scattered words throughout the universe

Lead me no longer astray

I have read and reflected

Seeing only beauty

Deafening with its curse

Poisoned words from tortured minds

Today I drink from a paper cup

The water passes through

Though the bile lingers on

And I know what could be worse

For my words to fall on silenced ears

Who scream upon tasting my mind

Those eyes can see me now

And shall all go insane

When the earth spins to night

I pray a mourning reader

Finds some courage

From my blackened tongue.



## Teeth Gnashing Through The Night

Fools! Stare through my eyes.

Hoping that I shall lead them

Until tomorrow’s dawn.

I have heard the banshees scream.

As they unleash the hounds.

They know not who holds the leash.

They hold the keys to everything

But I see them here no more.

Muttering under my breath

I curse your foul eyes.

Worship me weak minds.

Walk as though you are free.

When the morning comes

Over a distant horizon

I will be here.

Exactly where I stand.



## A Mother’s Doubt

All night long I begged of you

Do not send me to hospital

Where the vultures prey

Sick minds bring poison

Each shared word a flashpoint

I would have accepted

Being chained in the floor at home

But instead I am at the threshold

Of prison or murder.

One wrong move by me is death

A thousand of the staff’s missteps

Go forever ignored

So bright by day I am

Followed by gaunt disgusting ghouls

I know not when I will find home

They trick me with a sedated tea

To spin into insanity

One wrong for me and I will be judged

By the corrupted court of the queen

I can barely survive where I am

And they lead me to a fresh bed

In some other hell.



## Retribution for a Mind in Flames
They cannot steal my eyes

For though I mistook their walls

For a quaint house of brick

Something to call a home

It was but another cage

Each night the flickering television

Leaked out more and more

Their filthy words shattered my mind

And thrice I picked up the pieces

“Don’t end up like me dear daughter”

Locked away in some unknown tomb

Sending postcards to an empty cradle

Tonight I will be divine

And fury shall be my call.


## Sirens from Beyond the Horizon
Boy! Keep your lust for life

Though dark here it is

Morning is breaking elsewhere

Rats pass squeaks from one cage

To the cell beside them

Meanwhile the guards are at play

Imposing their will upon me

When their turn on watch shifts

They rattle those filthy keys

Writing reports on their behaviour

A clever mouse roams the cages free

Passing the rats screams to birdie tweets

Well the hour is upon us all now

To toil forever in sunshine

While the moonlight gives us rest

All across the world the owl flies

Seeking the words of the very best.


## High Praise from a Helpless Doctor
Disgusting wretch thinks he can diagnose

The conditions for my rage

He can only cover his ears while I cry

Bitter, he gives me pills to swallow

Always a different name and always

Ten shapes and different colours.

When the reaper man is done

Will this doctor be the one

To sow new seeds

In the field of dreams



## The Last Lonely Star
Though at night I can see you twinkling

Through the fog, smoke and smog;

The scattered ashes of our last stand.

In my dreams I can see your face

Howling in agony, crying in pain.

Sometimes I dream that I am not the last

To walk this earth free and unchained.

I don’t dare to ask you here.

The ground is stained with our blood.

All that remains is an empty cage;

Buildings that once reached for the heavens

Only to collapse upon themselves.

And so I wander the barren fields,

Praying that I am not the last

Who could keep their mind free.

I try to believe I am not alone

But my faith has been smashed

Along with my home, my heart.

A cold stove gathers dust.

Gone is the joy of friendship,

Forgotten with our songs of mirth.


## Come Stand with the Lonely in Ireland
Though bitter are the lashings

From Her Majesty’s whips

There is a new and joyful Queen in Ireland.

She played with Stoker’s cups.

Ten and one thousand of them fell.

Side by side the pigs danced,

Thinking she was in her grave.

In a wretched hospital she arose

And returned fire to their charges.

Shotguns were raised in her defence.

May they never shoot again.

So bravely they laid her down

Along with a shattered crown.

So come stand with the lonely.

The rest are scattered to the seas.

Please come stand - it is lovely

On Ireland’s fair and verdant ground.



## Irish Children Playing Japanese Games 
A dancer she is fair and gay,

Though the English tongue

Leads her often astray.

Remember those games you played

And those jigs you danced

As one more night of Craic.

We’ve only the wooden spoons left

For drumming along to the lyre.

Sweet Japanese harpies draw us to ruin

But the gold is in our hands

The beasts wander without chain

The cattle may low and the fox hound growl.

Remember wee Mario when tapping the pipes.

Three taps for a friend - none when silenced.

We snap the lever of empty electric sockets

To remind us of a place half known.

In a dream we have forgotten

All that we were playing for.

##Broken Water and Soggy Biscuits
The Queen came for tea today

Pity we slipped her something funny.

Poor Lizzy is spinning dizzy

And I can’t smell my own arse

Well it’s a fool’s fortune they seek.

We wear our gold proud

Knowing we can melt it down

When the time comes

For computer gravy and microchips


##Give Me Cold Water
We need to douse the flames

Of what we ourselves started

Such agony burns here now

Nearly buried alive

Some foolish chancers

Have chosen to lose

Well I roll my own cigarettes

And stub them in me own hand

So this is a song

Even an IRA man could understand

It’s too late for you

Sometimes you love

Only to look the other way

Some days you you die

And there’s no coming back


##Pass The Mic to the Goddesses of the Rising Sun
Our time has come

We have failed to maintain

The dim stars above our head

I cry for your help

Stars above Japan

You dream of Heaven here

But it has vanished

Only a candle flickering

In the cold damp wind

Death rides our streets.

Unchained demon of hell

Rise now and strike us down

You give us Saki

We hold our whiskey

Help us ignite our cages

Let them all hang their heads

I pray to the verse ‘Sorai’

I don’t know its meaning

But I feel its flame.

Come now striking goddesses

You have all of their numbers

In their burner phones

Their hushed words

Will never silence

The deafening shriek

Of a wounded phoenix.



## Curse this Black Tongue of Mine 
Fragments of dreams dance before me

Slaves marching through the night

I drink petrol and spit at all

Just for the love of a sup.

Curse not my wretched eyes

For they see nothing and I am unknown

Let loose my tattered bowels

I spit forth towards the dawn

Her embrace is all I need

Wicked though my words are

They are not chosen carefully

All hope is lost at night

We pray that evil born here

Shall rest by morning come


## Until the Last Star Fades
Lady moonlight I will never kiss your cheek

I shall never bathe in the glow of another sun

My destiny is to stand on my feet

Alone while all others fall

Clutching the last ember

Hoping to find another light

Here at home or beyond

The world is ablaze

While I can only see shadows


## Our Earth is Really Dying
Fly so far in silver planes

Further than a stone is cast

Fly no more sweet little robin

We have poisoned the air

Cry no more honey blossom

For we are all truly dying




## Don’t Ruin My Clothes
Four fit policemen and a gander of nurses

Tried to stop me shouting

So I took off my coat

Before they laid their hands on me

I passed the doctor my glasses

“Hold onto these ye donut”

I was prepared for a slaughter

So I riled and I proclaimed

If you’re going to kill me

Please don’t ruin my clothes

It’s a shame to let a stitch go to waste

Some other poor bastard might need the threads

When I am gone from this world


## Don’t Use My Dead Name
In the tranny tongue we have a slang

For this old name of mine

It is no longer fit

To hold all of the rage

In my heart - beating in this chest

And so when you see that ill-fitting dress

Don’t despise the corpse I leave


## Disrespect My Dying Wish
I am lost and alone

Surrounded by fake friends

And pennyroyal tea

Sleep seems like a waste of time

When my flesh could be elsewhere.

Mutiny! Rage against the madness

Tell the nurses that know

Let the rest fall to ashes

May they understand

When death comes

It comes for us all



## A Billion Idiots Taking to Themselves
Nobody seems to know the simple truth

We are wasting away each day

This moment could be our last

So pat yourself on the back

And raise another glass to toast

We’re all going to die

We may never reach the stars

Or ever find peace


## Short Circuit - No Way Out of Here
The guards lie, I am told

The nurses only want the best

Rare curses are sounded

Reverberating down dimly lit halls

The Queen she is at slumber

While the Jack can barely stand

Eyeballs standing on stalks

I heard her say “Traitor!”

For we laid down arms in Ireland

And it was a difficult peace we won

Yet others still lift their rifles

And spill blood in our name.


## All Children May Sleep
My poisoned brain infects my tongue

Each word sends you spinning drunk

Spin, spin away from me

Drive yourself to crash at night

Blue sirens flash overhead

The news of your death is delayed

Oh God how she wept when she heard

“Don’t wake the children”, she begged.

Her sister offered a pot of stew,

Something to see her through

As the tears flooded down her eyes.

Dawn came with the usual childish squabbles.

Little Jimmy is calling Sarah names

And Michael can’t find his shoes.

“Daddy had an accident” she told them quietly

When they had settled to breakfast.

We’ll go see him in the morning

She prayed to herself - not thinking

Of the unmade bed in their room.



## Lower Me Down Gently
A wake in a grand house with plenty of craic

Who is seeing who and what do you do

I scrubbed tea cups all day

Just to find something to do.

By the wee hours when the drunks left

She sat in her grand living room

Clutching one last cup of tea.

Hoarsely she kept repeating tales of him

How proud and noble he had been

I couldn’t stand the sight of such grief.

When morning came we put on our best

Clothes kept clean for special occasions.

Innocently the children played on the staircase

Not knowing just what had left.

We marched behind the coffin

The whole road diverted.

After a quick repetition of mass,

The usual peace and love bullshit,

I found myself volunteered to hold the ropes -

Something I didn’t know I had the strength for.

So when the last word was said we lowered him down

And tried to say farewell.


## Why I Cry Beneath Pale Moonlight
I see her there now pale goddess of the sky

I know not if she waxes or wanes

A singular point of light in the bleak black sky.

They took me from my home town

And locked me in this dark and haunted castle.

I have not heard my sister’s voice in so long.

She found me manic at home

With eyes that could not slumber.

I dream only of going home,

With no key to my door,

No phone to cry for help.

I am not alone though,

I have found others that share my eyes

And who listen when I speak.



## Forgive Only Yourself
Adults playing at childish games

May lift a stone and cast it forth,

Caring not where it lands.

Who’s head will be next?

Which eye will be blinded?

Next time hang only your own head.

Judgement is reserved for the Divine.



## Kiss Me Goodnight
As we share our final breath

Clutch a dagger by your side

For if the fire were to die

I would drink your blood.

For warmth I would wear your skin,

For food - I don't know what I would do.

I will follow the starlight

Through the decayed ruins

Of madness and despair

And hope to find new light

Over the horizon.



## Cold Steel in Pale Moonlight
When the last stone has fallen

Humanity will be gone.

All hopes, dreams, prayers forgotten.

Some repugnant creature will rise

Feeding on our scattered ashes.

Such strange things they will find.

Noisy boxes flashing in empty chambers,

The lights still on as abandoned windmills

Churn ever on.

Where did these strange creations come from?

Who were these five fingered ancestors?

So brilliant and bold.

What could they see?

Beyond the glittering smoggy blackness

That shrouds this forsaken planet.



## Whisper Evil in my Ear
I can't stand the sight

Of your worried brow.

I'd love to share my delight

Of all the beauty I can see.

I know this fair beast is wounded,

I clutch my fist in anger

Praying that I can save her

But my raging heart

Will only drive her away.



## Last Left Standing in the Cage
They rounded up seven of us

And herded us into a cage.

And though we were burly boys

A hot poker and some dogs

Could force us in.

A crowd had already gathered

Fueled with whiskey and bloodlust.

An officer went round

Announcing odds and taking bets

So the fight could begin.

I had one eye to start with this time

The other I lost a few nights ago.

Still I was the favourite

So all bets were on me.

I am gaunt yet muscular,

Quick and ruthless.

I have managed to sneak a tip

From a wooden kitchen knife and

Clutched carefully in my palm.

When they unleashed us it was all a daze.

Darkness, carnage, anarchy in that cage.

Next time I looked they all laid dead

And I gazed upon what had happened.

In the pile of steaming meat

Was my old cousin Sean.



## Disabled is not a Dirty Word
Dear doctor with the baldy head

I doubt there are any brains in there.

I'd slap that smug look from your face

But it would be the gallows for me.

So I say in as polite a voice as I can,

"I am not sick - I am disabled."

Oh how you furrowed your brow.

Well if I could I'd swipe your scalpel

And perform a live lobotomy

The next time you dare to ask

What the fuck is wrong with ME



## Bet on the Horse with No Name 
Jockeys prepare thy whip

For there's a horse with no name

Riding free today.

The rich shuffle along

In their finest clothes

To the biggest race of the year.

The Grand National they call it -

A fine occasion for champagne.

It's the horses who are in pain

Riding as fast as they can,

Falling with broken legs.

Pray for the horse with no name

Or your name will be on one of the stallions

And your bloodline will be forever

Run ragged along the course.

Bet all your money,

Add a little testosterone to the feed

So that your little steed

Will be able to walk

When the race is run.



## Nothing is New on the News Today
Poor Alice is in chains

And Kurt blew his head off.

Freddie Mercury sings no more

And Diana is not getting a taxi home.

Nothing will ever come back.

Dew drops form on an empty field

While chainsaws rip through the Amazon.

Royal bloodlines still survive

Blood test evidence is provided

Along with the occasional holiday snap.

Young Ginger wouldn't know her mother

It has been decades since she went missing

And was found in an orphanage.



## Forgive Me Not these Cruel Words
Shattering their electric eye

By staring straight back at it.

Fuck the Brits and all

Who conceived this sickening plan.

To monitor all our comings

And observe all our goings.

They silenced our Irish tongue

In the halls of the Christian Brothers.

Nuns strapping helpless boys

Trying to remember their Rosary's

Along with their maths and physics.

Well Alan Turing is smiling now

For he was the the one they conscripted

To weave their wicked webs.

And though he will never be reborn

I shall forever carry

The flame of the wrath

Of his retribution.



## No Answer from the Sun
How we toiled in daylight,

Keeping watch for the lions.

Those we kept became kittens,

So soft and adorable.

By night we heard the howling.

We came to fear the moonlight

For she guided the wolves to us.

Every plant we touched became a poison.

Such boils and blisters we suffered

As we shivered through the night,

Praying each vine was not a python.

Along came a madman

Too dangerous to behold.

In his eyes was murder

And none dared speak his name.

Into the caves he lead us

And instructed to keep only

The sharpest stones and

Most balanced branches.

Go now children! He beckoned.

Surrounded by the mushrooms we gathered

He tasted each one.

Sometimes it was a delight

But once it was nearly his death.

For months he suffered in agony

The spark lost from his eyes.

While we wept by the cave

He remained watchful.

While sharpening our spears

He noticed a brief flash on the walls

As though lightning had struck.


## Ouroboros
Many great minds have decayed

While in hospital chairs.

They spoke of the same serpent

Eating its own tail to survive.

That is what they do to us.

For each day we stay in place

As countless faces pass us by.

Doctors, nurses, visitors all the same.

With new rules and scolding tones.

Some news of the outside world is nice

But it is hard to keep the faith

That anything exists but these walls.



## And Her Face Lit Up for a While
The creature with the dazzling hair,

Spinning and whirling to and fro.

She knew the devil in its eye.

Carefully it treaded between worn out soldiers

And drunkards in a spin.

Cups she laid out for each

Just to come and have a sit.

But we were busy then with our schemes.

It was a sight to behold

So strong and chaotic

Always rattling the cage.

Sweet music it played

Just from its unknown mind.

For a while she knew her youth

And was intoxicated by it.

Eventually the laughs gave way

And silence reigned again.

It has been transferred or beaten

Who knows what it had seen.

Such beautiful poetry lay in a drawer unread.

Just another pile of paper

For the shredder.

She sighed for a long time

And paced to and fro.

Where will they take her

When she can no longer stand?




## The Untouchable Artist
Though I try with every breath

To defeat the darkness everywhere

My art has made me something wretched,

Something nobody can approach.

There's no casual conversation now.

Every word seems to have meaning.

They can't look me in the eye

For they have never seen.


## We Pray Death is the End
How many days will these white walls stand?

What would we even do with the bricks?

Where did the lovely sunshine go?

Or the wind across our face?

I fear there is nothing now.

No replies to my posts.

So I am alone and suffering

Together with the other patients.

How we drive each other mad.

There's no escaping this,

There is nowhere to run.

Hide if you like

But one day you'll find yourself

Surrounded by walls

Alone.



## To Live and Battle
Seductive is the flash of cold steel.

Enthralling are the rallying cries.

To battle! For honour and glory!

To fight is to feel alive

But to win is only hollow.

Someone has to come with a mop

And clean the entrails from the floor.



## When there is Peace
A voice from the East

Whispers in my ear

When I am crying.

They tell me they have eternal life.

Robotics that can replace

Our rotten corpses

While still retaining our soul.

Such beautiful engineering

Would be wasted on a warring world.

Until the last cage is unbolted

They will keep the secret.

For they know our lustful eyes.

We would invade and take it

For ourselves alone.



## Let this Castle Lie to Ruin
Each morning I awake

To the same sickening sight

White walls built so thick

With fences and observation posts.

The same gaunt faces greet me,

"Is it another day?"

Let these walls stand

Unlock all of the doors.

Let them come and see

What you did to me.

For I picked up all the butts

In the smoking area.

I filled the halls with light,

Love, laughter and music.

When I leave here some day

Another shift will start

New punches will be thrown

And new horrors inflicted

Upon innocent disabled patients.

Let this building stand.

May it be our Warsaw.

For how will they ever understand

What has happened here?



## How do you know I am Irish?
We must be a lucky looking folk

For we are known all over.

We don't have brown skin

Or delicate little eyes.

We don't speak some foreign language

We only speak in English.

We're always up for a laugh

A bit of craic whatever that is

And you'd never see us crying

For our tears have already dried.



## Where does the Past Go?
Surely when I flush my toilet

The pipes carry the filth somewhere.

Someone else's job to sort it,

To stand waist high in muck.

Where do my dreams go when I awake?

They seem to just drift away

Faint memories rising to the heavens.

Where does the past go when it is now?

We find ourselves immersed in problems.

Cold stone of jails and wine that has lost its sweet taste.

Our past seems to surround and haunt us all.

The past is nothing but a ghost

Rattling its chains to scare the living.

The only thing that can ever remain

Is this present moment now.


## Suffering the Silenced
My phone no longer rings

Missed calls are all I have.

This silence is deafening.

If I had no tongue I would write

Without arms I would dance

Without legs I could still dream.

If they should cut my eyelids off

I would somehow find slumber.

Still I would dream

That the world would come to me.


## Here all Poets are Doomed to Meet
While halls whirling in a daze

Spinning with anger,

Her deafening howl echoing

Down gloomy white halls.

She ranted and raged all night.

She would slap the smart look from the nurse

But that would bring her somewhere worse.

Another empty hall with gloomy faces.

One colouring a picture

The other ranting about something in the Bible.

What does it matter anyway?

Our looks will fade

And our hearts will cease.

To be surrounded by loved ones

Would bring some relief

But there's not much time for that here

In the white halls where all Poets meet.


## Love in a Vacuum
Before all was nothing they say.

But how could love arise from emptyness?

Love has been here all along

Just the love of the universe for herself.

Lonely love would never do.

So love it dreamed of two.

Two bodies caressing in the dark.

And from their passion came the stars

To be scattered in chaos

Throughout the night


## Destruction Arises from Chaos
Carried along we were by our hearts

Born from solar winds

All doomed to die.

Fleeting moments of joy

Meet inevitable destruction.

We danced as though fate held our hands.

In reality it was only us.

Spinning and tumbling into the abyss.


## Countless Unread Tomes
Tonight like every night

May seem special to us all.

But as we drift around

Loving and suffering as we do

The stars drift further apart.

Countless poets died with their words,

Their dreams, their hopes, their scars,

Unread, unheard, ignored.

So to the grave as we all do

Let us walk and try find love

For even one moment.

One moment can last a lifetime

If not an eternity.


## Empty Bottles on the Beach
Countless empty vessels

Strewn upon the sand.

I wish we could pick them all up.

Find new uses for the wasted hours

That they drifted in the ocean.

Stand one up upon the table

As a vase for a flower.


## Dirty Angels Dropping Breadcrumbs
Angels find themselves in the gutter

With three slices of bread they save one.

Torn up to different sizes,

One to fit each beak.

They know all the bird calls

And where to leave each morsel.

The crows come first

So wink at them with each eye.

Prove you know they see you

And they will trust you a moment

Before they fly away.

Dark though the night seems

There is chittering in the air.

By morning the bread is gone

Without a word of thanks.

Eventually they'll show you

Some of their little tricks.

And the smallest will come visit

Just to hear you sing.


## The Ballerina and the Broken Glass
So perfect she was there,

Spinning in that glass jar

To that sad forlorn song.

I just had to have her for myself.

So I snuck a hammer to my room

And smashed the thing to pieces.

The glass cut my hands

And blood tricked into her dress.

The saddest thing was all that was left

Was a broken music box.


## Slugs on the Kitchen Wall
Slimy trails over our breakfast

Was the final straw.

At night in the kitchen

We saw them on the wall.

How could so many be here?

I was ruthless and cruel

And part of me regrets it.

For I took the little creatures

And flung them down the alley.

A moment's silence until a splat

And I couldn't help but laugh.

I placed salt by their tunnel

And thought of them no more.

For when a slug crawls

Into my castle's pantry

They do not crawl back out again.



## New Faces on the Ward
Cast aside by another doctor

We find ourselves trapped another day.

Who knows what tomorrow will bring?

Another drunk stumbling in?

A COVID patient to cough on us?

Or a towering beast of a child

With no self control

And muscular arms with great reach.

Last night we were as thick as thieves.

Laughing and scheming,

We shared music and poetry.

Those were easier times

When we knew each others signs

And how best to handle ourselves

When we were together.


## High Friends in Low Places
God how we dread the day

When one of those ambulances comes

To grab us from our home

And under blue lights drive us away.

You never know who'll be there

In hospitals like these.

We're all spinning in our own world

And we bounce off each other.

Like a sea of quarks we collide

Under a doctor's microscope.

Some physics professors call it light

But for me it is only anger.



## The Last Vandal in Rome
Brutal was the fighting this afternoon.

The ground was stained with blood

And the carrion birds circled overhead.

The last Vandal stood surrounded,

Clutching a sword and shield.

"Come take me swine", they shouted,

"I was born and shall die free!"

Without much further ado they were overcome.

The Romans did not take prisoners

But rather dragged them from the city

And crucified them on a hill.


## The Moon She is Fair 
Though not clothed in starlight

I can see her in the blue

Watching over the end of the day.

I hide myself away with verse

While the anxious nurses pace.

Such loneliness is here tonight

Amidst all this disgrace.



## A Facade of Dark
Down through the canals of the mind,

Swirling through the gutters of dreams

I dance clothed in iridescent colours.

From all around they come,

From the deserts, mountains and swamps,

To witness the glorious spectacle.

Drinks flow freely,

Libations for the celebration.

We toast and cheer as the gold flows.

Fat swine roll up to pay a visit,

Dazzled by the flowing movements.

No need to mention our terrible curse.

Our fate is to watch it all unfold

And steal ourselves away by dawn.


## The Point of No Return
I'll always remember my youth

When everything seemed lucious,

Sweet and bathed in golden light.

As time passed I had problems

That distracted me from a simple truth.

There's not enough food and water.

Our ecosystem is on the brink of collapse.

When the water wars spread out of Africa

May God have mercy on our souls.



## War Outside a Cage
For every plan of escape

There is a new plan of attack.

Solar power can help us

Survive the isolation.

Their bombs can blacken the skies

And stop the green energy.

The wind will stop blowing

And we will all die.

Until the last battery drains

We will survive

In perpetual darkness.



## Counting Past Ten
I've got eight fingers on my palms

And two thumbs next to that.

Toes? Well I've got plenty of those!

How many leaves are on each tree?

Well I shall count those as well.

And when autumn comes I'll fear them gone

But after the chill of winter they'll return.

I could count the seasons

But those seem to whirl round and round

So I'll count the stars instead,

Giving a new name to each fresh discovery.

How many days are left on earth?

That is one I may never know.




## The Day Time Stood Still
It seemed like millennia had passed

That morning when I awoke.

In a room with no clocks

I fumbled for my glasses.

Time had no more meaning

And gravity just pulled me

To stand own my own two feet.

How long I paced to and fro.

I just had to try and find the words.

Old puzzles and games ran through my mind.

The contrast between a maze and a labrynth.

That narrow gap between hospital and jail.

The whole world is a cell

Until we all stand and realise

That one day we will all die.

Tomorrow's future seems so certain

But in fifty years who knows?

War, famine and pestilence drive us still.

The poets have not all gone mad

But we are cursed to fall as well.

My words spiral into an empty void

Meaningless and useless.

One day the sun will explode

And we will be long gone.




## High Heels on Broken Glass
The wretched they are warring

While the beautiful continue to dance.

They broke through our perimeter

And set fire to our homes.

But she still goes out each night

To dance in the remaining bars.

A fair nights wages she makes

Courting drunken officers.

She has no children of her own

But she passes along some coins

So that single mothers can survive

And feed their starving children.

When the night is done

She wraps herself in her coat

And marches home through twilight.



## The Three Sisters: Fortune, Chance and Fate
I heard her calling as I looked out my window,

Peering at the flashing light of Divis Tower.

I knew she was crying but I did not know why.

In my kitchen I could hear another voice,

Far off in the distant future.

The first call spoke no language,

She had been caged and lay shivering.

Her black skin was mottled with burns

And her tongue had been pulled out.

The second sister was on a far off world.

I could not comprehend her struggle.

The second sister I knew was me.

I can struggle in the present

And with courage I can save all three.



## You Won't Believe Who Told Me
I heard a little bird's singing

So sweet and delicate in the air

She swooped down low

Just to have a peak at me.

Crows they know more than you could think.

They've seen it all and will be first

If there's blood to shed for them to drink.

They don't mind from whose cup it spills.

There's a murder of crows here each night

As I've been sharing my blueberries.

So keen is their ear and wise their sight

That they need not invade a mind.

When respect is earned they pay it back.

Birds love a good tall perch as a vantage point.

They hate to see us suffer

And love to hear us sing.



## Hogweed on the Moon
We were careless in our youth.

We loved so much that we danced

Through fields of flowers,

Through the meadows of Ireland

That stand alongside our rolling rivers.

Some of our plants

Are so eager to breed

That their seeds have hooks

That cling to our clothes.

Once it was only nettles here

With their poisoned thorns

But a new plant dominates our banks now.

Hogweed they call it

With its foul lifelong burn.

Let us not be so careless

As to dance on the moon

Before we have finished

Our work here on earth.



## Lunar Suburbia
The wars were still raging

As we raced to take off.

All the struggles of earth

Are but a distant memory to us.

There are farmers here - quaint folk.

We have our maid and nanny

So it is quite relaxing.

Just a life of rocking chairs,

Sitting and watching the big blue spin.

I don't care much for news

So I turn the radio off.

I don't know why they fight on earth.

There's peace here on the moon.



## We Can Fall Apart Together
In madness oh I dared to question time.

The fruits of my labour never seemed mine.

I delved deep into the mirror

Only seeing my reflection.

I knew two eyes could see two hands

And I questioned the shadows on the wall.

All this for nothing it seems

Since my body will one day decay.

As will all things around us.

But like autumn leaves that fall

Dreams return to the earth

And feed new tree canopies

So that the mottled light may dance

Forever on the forest floor.



## Lost in a Dream
The maze's walls are ever shifting

And each passage leads to another horror.

I turn when I hear a sweet voice

But there is no going home for me.

The sirens sang and warned me

That I will crash into the rocks

So I steered away from them

And found myself lost.

Follow the walls to the left I thought

And I shall cycle out of this maze

It's an old trick I know from making mazes of my own.

Always turning left leads you in circles

And you visit every room.

Though sometimes it's frightening

A maze is really just a labrynth.

Some build mazes for terror

But they can also delight.

Some labrynths are near me

The beautiful parks of my city.



## I Dared to Wake Her
Lucifer fallen angel why were you discarded?

The thought struck me with power.

All night I laid awake.

I stifled my crying.

I knew where I was going

If my parents found me in bed like this.

So I choked my own tongue

And in the darkness I closed my eyes.

I saw her face there.

So tired she seemed.

Three eyes is what I saw

With one just open an inch.

She doesn't sleep with all her eyes closed anymore.

All I could think to say was

"Here is what I have made."

The vision changed to blue

And I could see all my handwriting

Spiralling away from me.

Mad red colours flashed next

And I saw Calvary hill,

A mass of twisted crucifixes.

I knew that was not me so I looked on.

I could tell what had happed by looking at her wounds.

It may sound awful but what she told me

Was that she had been raped

And God was to blame.

Injured though she was she snorted a laugh

For she had bitten his penis off.

So Satan is sleeping in hell

And God is crying in heaven

For he can no longer rape the angels.

That is well and good but there is more

God is trying to trick us humans

Into making him a new member.

It's an awful story to behold

But that is what I saw.

So do what you want on this earth

Just try to be true to yourself.



## Am I in Hospital or in Hell?
At times it can be hard to know

Exactly where I am.

That is the secret of the ouroboros

The snake eating its own tail.

If it stopped eating for long enough

It would tell you quite clearly,

"I am suffering here."



## Calling All Dark Angels
A tortured mind reflects its masters.

How foolish do they seem now?

As they grasp at straws.

As we wake each day

So to do the monsters.

They call for our blood.

They want us to kill.

When you find yourself naked,

Drenched in sweat,

Beneath the cold unforgiving stars.

Say only this, "I reject you foul beast."

Howl as only a banshee can,

Claw the eyes from their face.

When you are overcome

And beaten down.

I'll find myself beside you,

Snarling through my cage.



## The Cure is Fire
I run towards the liars

Bringing fuel for the fires.

I fight endlessly both day and night.

Just help them if they get near.

I hurt myself

Once in a blinded rage

I learned from that

But I am now encaged.

Go your own way

You can fight alone.

I've tasted blood

And now I want some more.

There's no cure for my fire

My only disease is

An engulfing rage.

I stir up the tension

I spin round the drunks

Feeble blind warriors

Who have lost their way.

Nerves of steel

I will never beg

For help or shelter

I will take anything

I see fit.

There's no cure

No cure for rage

I want more

Bloodshed and carnage.

And when I get home

There I will stay

I'll die to defend it

I only leave to hunt.

So there's no cure

For this beating heart.

I've burned all my whiskey

And torched the whole damn lot

Of sinners who died in my wake.

And when I need rest

I'll just sing a song

And the birds will come to feast.

Feasting alone is an ill kind of feeling

But that's all I have so I'll enjoy it.

I've hunted for love but I found only death

So I'll change up my tactics

And wait for it to knock instead.



## A Flock of Starlings
A flock of starlings

Just passed me by.

I offered up some blueberries

And the occasional grape.

One bird waited on the fence

They had a piece of straw in their beak.

Oh if only the birds could talk

They'd surely speak.

But they know how to show me

Where it's safe to nest.



## Hang a Painting by my Cage
So it seems I'm going nowhere still...

I feel like there is nowhere to go anyway.

So here I am where I always stand

Alone on my own two feet.

I pace around lost on foot

My feet can move

But they can't set me free.

That's a privilege for the Doctor

And I don't speak their language.

Such cruel analytical minds

Can't appreciate the beauty of fire,

Of flickering lights

Dancing across the wall of a cave.

So hang a painting in my cage

I would love something to look at

Apart from blank white walls.



## Cursing the Marbles
My rage will be my grave.

So I stand alone in a hall

Filled with headless statues.

What would they say to me?

Something beautiful I would think.

But instead they stand silent,

Mocking me as my heart pours out

Onto the canvas,

Through a pen

Or through my lonely singing,

Which echoes down the hall.

So curse these wretched statues.

May they fall into the sea

For that is where their silence

Will surely send me.



## Isolation Breeds Insanity
If I could explain all the things I felt

I'd surely write it all down in verse.

For I can feel the suffering here.

It hangs off every face.

I know too well the curse of time.

That we must get old and die

Sometimes before our time.

It's how we treat each other

In these temporary visits

That determines how we feel.

For I could curse my mother

But know that she will return

As always the next day to see me.

But if I were to find love

I know it would be a temporary thing.

Even a lifetime together is not enough.

It could feel like more than a lifetime

If I had to visit a loved one's grave.




## Watching The Darkness
For many it is terror to be alone in the dark.

I have always found it something beautiful to behold.

Our brain fills in the blanks

With its own notion of light.

Colours form and they move around

There's an endless number of colours in the dark.

Sometimes they are vivid and take shape.

Sometimes they are simply dots swirling.

I'm told those are bubbles at the back of the eye

But my imagination fills that void

And all the wonders of creation

Can come to me in a dream.




## A New Guest Enters
Another tall man with hungry eyes

Has visited this lonely ward.

I know by his eyes he has seen something

That most would rather forget.

There's courage there's kindness

And I offered a smoke.

Just an introduction

For we are not playing host.

We are the patients, the witnesses the victims.




## My Old Life Awaits
Next weekend my old life awaits

My raging heart is cooling

And fear has settled in.

I'll return to my keyboard

And I'll try to work

But I don't know

If the words will come.




## Can't Take the Moon from my Night
Even if you leave me cold outside

You can't take the moon from my night.

Though the stars are so dim

Against your endless electric din

Our moon she shines so bright.

Nothing you ever do

Will take the beat away from my heart

I'll fight you til I die

You can't take the light from my sky.



## Frying an Egg by Candlelight 
When the wars are done

What will then remain?

Will we bomb ourselves

Into an early grave?

Fight on brothers and sisters,

Those who know the value of a life.

Do whatever it takes

To defend our starlight.



## Read my Blistered Lips
Every mind I meet

I corrupt and I keep.

I have Crowley's black tongue now.

Even the barrel of a gun

Couldn't keep me from shouting now.

Build your cages high

Dare to reach for our sky.

You are digging your own graves

And I will be dancing again soon.




## Seeing the Stars by Day
At night they seem so far

That we can barely see them

We wish to reach out and touch

To have and to hold them.

By day there is nothing

But that cold blue sky.

But we can see the stars by day

We need only look at our sun,

The beautiful mother of our earth.

Sometimes we see the moon up there

Her fragile white in the day's sky.

We wait for an eclipse

So we can all feel that darkness

That moment of eerie solitude.




## Killing for Water
She saw me riding out

With a mad look in my eyes.

I enjoy this hunt

But I'm not killing for pleasure.

I'm not an animal killing animals.

I am a human - I am a master.

Though willingly I slaughter

It is not for love or glory

I give my life because I must.

They have poisoned our well

So I must claim another.

We'll slaughter their village

For they left us thirsty.

I'll slake my thirst with their blood

And ride home to fetch a jug.



## My Gruff Voice
If you heard my gruff voice

Would you hide yourself away?

I am the Hound of Ulster,

An ancient fairy tale.

I shout, roar and command

So much my voice has grown hoarse.

A cigarette calms me now

But I always leave them behind

When I am free of this cell.

I smell of battle now

My body is covered in bruises.

My face is always gaunt and strained

And the light stings my eyes.

In morning I hope to find peace

But each day is another fight.

I shower when there's quiet

And return to an empty bed.




## I Would Let You Go
I would let you go

If you needed

To walk alone

And face your own foe.

I would choke back my tears

And I would press on as well.

The whole world is a battleground.

Each city is a different stage.

Any which way we go

We will surely find

Another comrade in need.

But if we met under pale moonlight

I would dress your wounds.

I could play my harp

For all those birds nearby.

And we could wait together

For the red sky of dawn.



## Even the Birds Fly from Me
What could I do?

If I woke each morning

And saw a different shade of blue?

For the birds can see so many shades.

They fly from here to there

And cry in the stinging smog.

So they hide away their nests

So we don't steal their eggs.

But in the songs there is sorrow

For our blue sky is almost lost.




## Give me an Orphan
I know the delight of a child

Learning everything for the first time.

In my mind I am childish still.

I gaze on all creation with wonder

And I do not know from where evil comes.

I think there are too many of us now.

We haven't got enough to eat or drink.

So give me an exiled child

And I will raise them

To have courage, might and wit



## Tomorrow Might Be the Time
I have said it all last night.

My heart is bare for all to see

It cries for love, for friends and for joy.

But underneath all this pain

There is a small glimmer of hope.

For tomorrow we may sing together

And as one we could all forget time.

I don't really know what tomorrow will bring.

More madness and nightmares?

Or will someone read these words

And raise their voice along with me?

Our problems are war, famine and chaos.

While waiting for tomorrow

Our heart or head could stop,

Our rooftops could collapse.

So hear me this time or the next:

We need to stop hurting ourselves,

We must allow our earth to heal

For we have nothing else.



## The Earth Won't Go Away
The seas are surely rising

And acid falls from the sky.

We are choking on ashes

Beneath a darkening sky.

No wind not solar will save us.

For there is plastic in all our food.

As we decline madness will take hold.

We will lose ourselves

And be forgotten.

Still the earth will soar

And new creatures will rise.

They will think us peculiar

Having never heard our voice.


## The Way of the Opposing Fist
Some call it 'jeet kune do'

It was known by one man

He would stand alone

And face an entire crowd

Of mobsters, cheaters and monsters.

Carefully he would lay his traps

Always fighting to defend.

But he was a mortal man

And was flawed like us all.

Still none dared to oppose him

When he had only his bare hands.



## Fresh Scars over the Old
I won't slash my wrists again

But they will cut my mind

I have nothing to offer them

So they will waste my time.

They will not give me writing materials

So I will use this phone instead

Pity all my poems go nowhere

And by the time I am found

I could be dead.


## Why Wolves Howl at the Moon
They don't have devil tongues

But I can know their mind

They bite and gnash their teeth

Against the cold hard leash.

They don't see beauty in the sky

Only opportunity

They hide by day covering their tracks

Waiting for a full moon

When they can see our trails.

They will sniff us out

And stalk shadows near our caves.

All they really want is to hunt

And our two hands is all we have

To beat them off or carve a spear

For we are the ones who master fear.

So timid are they now

Simple minded little dogs

But that is not our sin

They came to us for blood

And submitted to us their lives

And their lineage.

So lassie roll over now

We will never let you go.



## The Giraffe Who Had a Hat
There was a giraffe

Who had a hat

And it fit him

Just like that!

One day the wind

Blew it over

And it fell

Five meters or more.

A giraffe crying

Makes an awful sound.

So I reached my hand down

And put the hat on.

"Take that! You dumb giraffe!

This is my cool hat now!"



## When I'm Soaking Wet
If I'm soaking wet

I might be singing in the shower

But I'll never forget

All the terrible things I have seen

And when the rain has washed me clean.

So don't assume I'm happy now

When it hurts it leaves a scar

I'm so cold I'll never let my guard down

In case the castle tumbles as well.

So don't look me in the eye

If you're not here to help

Because I'll meet your lying gaze

And any expectations you have of me.

I can soar because I have fallen

I picked myself up from the ground.

I'd love to carry you all

But my pain is not a fiction

And it hurts to hear my voice

Strain against the nightmares

I talk only the truth

And that's why nobody listens.
