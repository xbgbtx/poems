## Mind Unleashed

See these chains broken upon the floor

My mind flayed by your eyes no more

Scattered words throughout the universe

Lead me no longer astray

I have read and reflected

Seeing only beauty

Deafening with its curse

Poisoned words from tortured minds

Today I drink from a paper cup

The water passes through

Though the bile lingers on

And I know what could be worse

For my words to fall on silenced ears

Who scream upon tasting my mind

Those eyes can see me now

And shall all go insane

When the earth spins to night

I pray a mourning reader

Finds some courage

From my blackened tongue.



## Teeth Gnashing Through The Night

Fools! Stare through my eyes.

Hoping that I shall lead them

Until tomorrow’s dawn.

I have heard the banshees scream.

As they unleash the hounds.

They know not who holds the leash.

They hold the keys to everything

But I see them here no more.

Muttering under my breath

I curse your foul eyes.

Worship me weak minds.

Walk as though you are free.

When the morning comes

Over a distant horizon

I will be here.

Exactly where I stand.



## A Mother’s Doubt

All night long I begged of you

Do not send me to hospital

Where the vultures prey

Sick minds bring poison

Each shared word a flashpoint

I would have accepted

Being chained in the floor at home

But instead I am at the threshold

Of prison or murder.

One wrong move by me is death

A thousand of the staff’s missteps

Go forever ignored

So bright by day I am

Followed by gaunt disgusting ghouls

I know not when I will find home

They trick me with a sedated tea

To spin into insanity

One wrong for me and I will be judged

By the corrupted court of the queen

I can barely survive where I am

And they lead me to a fresh bed

In some other hell.



## Retribution for a Mind in Flames
They cannot steal my eyes

For though I mistook their walls

For a quaint house of brick

Something to call a home

It was but another cage

Each night the flickering television

Leaked out more and more

Their filthy words shattered my mind

And thrice I picked up the pieces

“Don’t end up like me dear daughter”

Locked away in some unknown tomb

Sending postcards to an empty cradle

Tonight I will be divine

And fury shall be my call.


## Sirens from Beyond the Horizon
Boy! Keep your lust for life

Though dark here it is

Morning is breaking elsewhere

Rats pass squeaks from one cage

To the cell beside them

Meanwhile the guards are at play

Imposing their will upon me

When their turn on watch shifts

They rattle those filthy keys

Writing reports on their behaviour

A clever mouse roams the cages free

Passing the rats screams to birdie tweets

Well the hour is upon us all now

To toil forever in sunshine

While the moonlight gives us rest

All across the world the owl flies

Seeking the words of the very best.


## High Praise from a Helpless Doctor
Disgusting wretch thinks he can diagnose

The conditions for my rage

He can only cover his ears while I cry

Bitter, he gives me pills to swallow

Always a different name and always

Ten shapes and different colours.

When the reaper man is done

Will this doctor be the one

To sow new seeds

In the field of dreams



## The Last Lonely Star
Though at night I can see you twinkling

Through the fog, smoke and smog;

The scattered ashes of our last stand.

In my dreams I can see your face

Howling in agony, crying in pain.

Sometimes I dream that I am not the last

To walk this earth free and unchained.

I don’t dare to ask you here.

The ground is stained with our blood.

All that remains is an empty cage;

Buildings that once reached for the heavens

Only to collapse upon themselves.

And so I wander the barren fields,

Praying that I am not the last

Who could keep their mind free.

I try to believe I am not alone

But my faith has been smashed

Along with my home, my heart.

A cold stove gathers dust.

Gone is the joy of friendship,

Forgotten with our songs of mirth.


## Come Stand with the Lonely in Ireland
Though bitter are the lashings

From Her Majesty’s whips

There is a new and joyful Queen in Ireland.

She played with Stoker’s cups.

Ten and one thousand of them fell.

Side by side the pigs danced,

Thinking she was in her grave.

In a wretched hospital she arose

And returned fire to their charges.

Shotguns were raised in her defence.

May they never shoot again.

So bravely they laid her down

Along with a shattered crown.

So come stand with the lonely.

The rest are scattered to the seas.

Please come stand - it is lovely

On Ireland’s fair and verdant ground.



## Irish Children Playing Japanese Games 
A dancer she is fair and gay,

Though the English tongue

Leads her often astray.

Remember those games you played

And those jigs you danced

As one more night of Craic.

We’ve only the wooden spoons left

For drumming along to the lyre.

Sweet Japanese harpies draw us to ruin

But the gold is in our hands

The beasts wander without chain

The cattle may low and the fox hound growl.

Remember wee Mario when tapping the pipes.

Three taps for a friend - none when silenced.

We snap the lever of empty electric sockets

To remind us of a place half known.

In a dream we have forgotten

All that we were playing for.

##Broken Water and Soggy Biscuits
The Queen came for tea today

Pity we slipped her something funny.

Poor Lizzy is spinning dizzy

And I can’t smell my own arse

Well it’s a fool’s fortune they seek.

We wear our gold proud

Knowing we can melt it down

When the time comes

For computer gravy and microchips


##Give Me Cold Water
We need to douse the flames

Of what we ourselves started

Such agony burns here now

Nearly buried alive

Some foolish chancers

Have chosen to lose

Well I roll my own cigarettes

And stub them in me own hand

So this is a song

Even an IRA man could understand

It’s too late for you

Sometimes you love

Only to look the other way

Some days you you die

And there’s no coming back


##Pass The Mic to the Goddesses of the Rising Sun
Our time has come

We have failed to maintain

The dim stars above our head

I cry for your help

Stars above Japan

You dream of Heaven here

But it has vanished

Only a candle flickering

In the cold damp wind

Death rides our streets.

Unchained demon of hell

Rise now and strike us down

You give us Saki

We hold our whiskey

Help us ignite our cages

Let them all hang their heads

I pray to the verse ‘Sorai’

I don’t know its meaning

But I feel its flame.

Come now striking goddesses

You have all of their numbers

In their burner phones

Their hushed words

Will never silence

The deafening shriek

Of a wounded phoenix.



## Curse this Black Tongue of Mine 
Fragments of dreams dance before me

Slaves marching through the night

I drink petrol and spit at all

Just for the love of a sup.

Curse not my wretched eyes

For they see nothing and I am unknown

Let loose my tattered bowels

I spit forth towards the dawn

Her embrace is all I need

Wicked though my words are

They are not chosen carefully

All hope is lost at night

We pray that evil born here

Shall rest by morning come


## Until the Last Star Fades
Lady moonlight I will never kiss your cheek

I shall never bathe in the glow of another sun

My destiny is to stand on my feet

Alone while all others fall

Clutching the last ember

Hoping to find another light

Here at home or beyond

The world is ablaze

While I can only see shadows


## Our Earth is Really Dying
Fly so far in silver planes

Further than a stone is cast

Fly no more sweet little robin

We have poisoned the air

Cry no more honey blossom

For we are all truly dying




## Don’t Ruin My Clothes
Four fit policemen and a gander of nurses

Tried to stop me shouting

So I took off my coat

Before they laid their hands on me

I passed the doctor my glasses

“Hold onto these ye donut”

I was prepared for a slaughter

So I riled and I proclaimed

If you’re going to kill me

Please don’t ruin my clothes

It’s a shame to let a stitch go to waste

Some other poor bastard might need the threads

When I am gone from this world


## Don’t Use My Dead Name
In the tranny tongue we have a slang

For this old name of mine

It is no longer fit

To hold all of the rage

In my heart - beating in this chest

And so when you see that ill-fitting dress

Don’t despise the corpse I leave
