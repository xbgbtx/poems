## Mind Unleashed

See these chains broken upon the floor

My mind flayed by your eyes no more

Scattered words throughout the universe

Lead me no longer astray

I have read and reflected

Seeing only beauty

Deafening with its curse

Poisoned words from tortured minds

Today I drink from a paper cup

The water passes through

Though the bile lingers on

And I know what could be worse

For my words to fall on silenced ears

Who scream upon tasting my mind

Those eyes can see me now

And shall all go insane

When the earth spins to night

I pray a mourning reader

Finds some courage

From my blackened tongue.



## Teeth Gnashing Through The Night

Fools! Stare through my eyes.

Hoping that I shall lead them

Until tomorrow’s dawn.

I have heard the banshees scream.

As they unleash the hounds.

They know not who holds the leash.

They hold the keys to everything

But I see them here no more.

Muttering under my breath

I curse your foul eyes.

Worship me weak minds.

Walk as though you are free.

When the morning comes

Over a distant horizon

I will be here.

Exactly where I stand.



## A Mother’s Doubt

All night long I begged of you

Do not send me to hospital

Where the vultures prey

Sick minds bring poison

Each shared word a flashpoint

I would have accepted

Being chained in the floor at home

But instead I am at the threshold

Of prison or murder.

One wrong move by me is death

A thousand of the staff’s missteps

Go forever ignored

So bright by day I am

Followed by gaunt disgusting ghouls

I know not when I will find home

They trick me with a sedated tea

To spin into insanity

One wrong for me and I will be judged

By the corrupted court of the queen

I can barely survive where I am

And they lead me to a fresh bed

In some other hell.



## Retribution for a Mind in Flames
They cannot steal my eyes

For though I mistook their walls

For a quaint house of brick

Something to call a home

It was but another cage

Each night the flickering television

Leaked out more and more

Their filthy words shattered my mind

And thrice I picked up the pieces

“Don’t end up like me dear daughter”

Locked away in some unknown tomb

Sending postcards to an empty cradle

Tonight I will be divine

And fury shall be my call.


## Sirens from Beyond the Horizon
Boy! Keep your lust for life

Though dark here it is

Morning is breaking elsewhere

Rats pass squeaks from one cage

To the cell beside them

Meanwhile the guards are at play

Imposing their will upon me

When their turn on watch shifts

They rattle those filthy keys

Writing reports on their behaviour

A clever mouse roams the cages free

Passing the rats screams to birdie tweets

Well the hour is upon us all now

To toil forever in sunshine

While the moonlight gives us rest

All across the world the owl flies

Seeking the words of the very best.


## High Praise from a Helpless Doctor
Disgusting wretch thinks he can diagnose

The conditions for my rage

He can only cover his ears while I cry

Bitter, he gives me pills to swallow

Always a different name and always

Ten shapes and different colours.

When the reaper man is done

Will this doctor be the one

To sow new seeds

In the field of dreams



## The Last Lonely Star
Though at night I can see you twinkling

Through the fog, smoke and smog;

The scattered ashes of our last stand.

In my dreams I can see your face

Howling in agony, crying in pain.

Sometimes I dream that I am not the last

To walk this earth free and unchained.

I don’t dare to ask you here.

The ground is stained with our blood.

All that remains is an empty cage;

Buildings that once reached for the heavens

Only to collapse upon themselves.

And so I wander the barren fields,

Praying that I am not the last

Who could keep their mind free.

I try to believe I am not alone

But my faith has been smashed

Along with my home, my heart.

A cold stove gathers dust.

Gone is the joy of friendship,

Forgotten with our songs of mirth.
