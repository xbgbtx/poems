## Mind Unleashed

See these chains broken upon the floor

My mind flayed by your eyes no more

Scattered words throughout the universe

Lead me no longer astray

I have read and reflected

Seeing only beauty

Deafening with its curse

Poisoned words from tortured minds

Today I drink from a paper cup

The water passes through

Though the bile lingers on

And I know what could be worse

For my words to fall on silenced ears

Who scream upon tasting my mind

Those eyes can see me now

And shall all go insane

When the earth spins to night

I pray a mourning reader

Finds some courage

From my blackened tongue.



## Teeth Gnashing Through The Night

Fools! Stare through my eyes.

Hoping that I shall lead them

Until tomorrow’s dawn.

I have heard the banshees scream.

As they unleash the hounds.

They know not who holds the leash.

They hold the keys to everything

But I see them here no more.

Muttering under my breath

I curse your foul eyes.

Worship me weak minds.

Walk as though you are free.

When the morning comes

Over a distant horizon

I will be here.

Exactly where I stand.



## A Mother’s Doubt

All night long I begged of you

Do not send me to hospital

Where the vultures prey

Sick minds bring poison

Each shared word a flashpoint

I would have accepted

Being chained in the floor at home

But instead I am at the threshold

Of prison or murder.

One wrong move by me is death

A thousand of the staff’s missteps

Go forever ignored

So bright by day I am

Followed by gaunt disgusting ghouls

I know not when I will find home

They trick me with a sedated tea

To spin into insanity

One wrong for me and I will be judged

By the corrupted court of the queen

I can barely survive where I am

And they lead me to a fresh bed

In some other hell.



## Retribution for a Mind in Flames
They cannot steal my eyes

For though I mistook their walls

For a quaint house of brick

Something to call a home

It was but another cage

Each night the flickering television

Leaked out more and more

Their filthy words shattered my mind

And thrice I picked up the pieces

“Don’t end up like me dear daughter”

Locked away in some unknown tomb

Sending postcards to an empty cradle

Tonight I will be divine

And fury shall be my call.


## Sirens from Beyond the Horizon
Boy! Keep your lust for life

Though dark here it is

Morning is breaking elsewhere

Rats pass squeaks from one cage

To the cell beside them

Meanwhile the guards are at play

Imposing their will upon me

When their turn on watch shifts

They rattle those filthy keys

Writing reports on their behaviour

A clever mouse roams the cages free

Passing the rats screams to birdie tweets

Well the hour is upon us all now

To toil forever in sunshine

While the moonlight gives us rest

All across the world the owl flies

Seeking the words of the very best.


## High Praise from a Helpless Doctor
Disgusting wretch thinks he can diagnose

The conditions for my rage

He can only cover his ears while I cry

Bitter, he gives me pills to swallow

Always a different name and always

Ten shapes and different colours.

When the reaper man is done

Will this doctor be the one

To sow new seeds

In the field of dreams



## The Last Lonely Star
Though at night I can see you twinkling

Through the fog, smoke and smog;

The scattered ashes of our last stand.

In my dreams I can see your face

Howling in agony, crying in pain.

Sometimes I dream that I am not the last

To walk this earth free and unchained.

I don’t dare to ask you here.

The ground is stained with our blood.

All that remains is an empty cage;

Buildings that once reached for the heavens

Only to collapse upon themselves.

And so I wander the barren fields,

Praying that I am not the last

Who could keep their mind free.

I try to believe I am not alone

But my faith has been smashed

Along with my home, my heart.

A cold stove gathers dust.

Gone is the joy of friendship,

Forgotten with our songs of mirth.


## Come Stand with the Lonely in Ireland
Though bitter are the lashings

From Her Majesty’s whips

There is a new and joyful Queen in Ireland.

She played with Stoker’s cups.

Ten and one thousand of them fell.

Side by side the pigs danced,

Thinking she was in her grave.

In a wretched hospital she arose

And returned fire to their charges.

Shotguns were raised in her defence.

May they never shoot again.

So bravely they laid her down

Along with a shattered crown.

So come stand with the lonely.

The rest are scattered to the seas.

Please come stand - it is lovely

On Ireland’s fair and verdant ground.



## Irish Children Playing Japanese Games 
A dancer she is fair and gay,

Though the English tongue

Leads her often astray.

Remember those games you played

And those jigs you danced

As one more night of Craic.

We’ve only the wooden spoons left

For drumming along to the lyre.

Sweet Japanese harpies draw us to ruin

But the gold is in our hands

The beasts wander without chain

The cattle may low and the fox hound growl.

Remember wee Mario when tapping the pipes.

Three taps for a friend - none when silenced.

We snap the lever of empty electric sockets

To remind us of a place half known.

In a dream we have forgotten

All that we were playing for.

##Broken Water and Soggy Biscuits
The Queen came for tea today

Pity we slipped her something funny.

Poor Lizzy is spinning dizzy

And I can’t smell my own arse

Well it’s a fool’s fortune they seek.

We wear our gold proud

Knowing we can melt it down

When the time comes

For computer gravy and microchips


##Give Me Cold Water
We need to douse the flames

Of what we ourselves started

Such agony burns here now

Nearly buried alive

Some foolish chancers

Have chosen to lose

Well I roll my own cigarettes

And stub them in me own hand

So this is a song

Even an IRA man could understand

It’s too late for you

Sometimes you love

Only to look the other way

Some days you you die

And there’s no coming back


##Pass The Mic to the Goddesses of the Rising Sun
Our time has come

We have failed to maintain

The dim stars above our head

I cry for your help

Stars above Japan

You dream of Heaven here

But it has vanished

Only a candle flickering

In the cold damp wind

Death rides our streets.

Unchained demon of hell

Rise now and strike us down

You give us Saki

We hold our whiskey

Help us ignite our cages

Let them all hang their heads

I pray to the verse ‘Sorai’

I don’t know its meaning

But I feel its flame.

Come now striking goddesses

You have all of their numbers

In their burner phones

Their hushed words

Will never silence

The deafening shriek

Of a wounded phoenix.



## Curse this Black Tongue of Mine 
Fragments of dreams dance before me

Slaves marching through the night

I drink petrol and spit at all

Just for the love of a sup.

Curse not my wretched eyes

For they see nothing and I am unknown

Let loose my tattered bowels

I spit forth towards the dawn

Her embrace is all I need

Wicked though my words are

They are not chosen carefully

All hope is lost at night

We pray that evil born here

Shall rest by morning come


## Until the Last Star Fades
Lady moonlight I will never kiss your cheek

I shall never bathe in the glow of another sun

My destiny is to stand on my feet

Alone while all others fall

Clutching the last ember

Hoping to find another light

Here at home or beyond

The world is ablaze

While I can only see shadows


## Our Earth is Really Dying
Fly so far in silver planes

Further than a stone is cast

Fly no more sweet little robin

We have poisoned the air

Cry no more honey blossom

For we are all truly dying




## Don’t Ruin My Clothes
Four fit policemen and a gander of nurses

Tried to stop me shouting

So I took off my coat

Before they laid their hands on me

I passed the doctor my glasses

“Hold onto these ye donut”

I was prepared for a slaughter

So I riled and I proclaimed

If you’re going to kill me

Please don’t ruin my clothes

It’s a shame to let a stitch go to waste

Some other poor bastard might need the threads

When I am gone from this world


## Don’t Use My Dead Name
In the tranny tongue we have a slang

For this old name of mine

It is no longer fit

To hold all of the rage

In my heart - beating in this chest

And so when you see that ill-fitting dress

Don’t despise the corpse I leave


## Disrespect My Dying Wish
I am lost and alone

Surrounded by fake friends

And pennyroyal tea

Sleep seems like a waste of time

When my flesh could be elsewhere.

Mutiny! Rage against the madness

Tell the nurses that know

Let the rest fall to ashes

May they understand

When death comes

It comes for us all



## A Billion Idiots Taking to Themselves
Nobody seems to know the simple truth

We are wasting away each day

This moment could be our last

So pat yourself on the back

And raise another glass to toast

We’re all going to die

We may never reach the stars

Or ever find peace


## Short Circuit - No Way Out of Here
The guards lie, I am told

The nurses only want the best

Rare curses are sounded

Reverberating down dimly lit halls

The Queen she is at slumber

While the Jack can barely stand

Eyeballs standing on stalks

I heard her say “Traitor!”

For we laid down arms in Ireland

And it was a difficult peace we won

Yet others still lift their rifles

And spill blood in our name.


## All Children May Sleep
My poisoned brain infects my tongue

Each word sends you spinning drunk

Spin, spin away from me

Drive yourself to crash at night

Blue sirens flash overhead

The news of your death is delayed

Oh God how she wept when she heard

“Don’t wake the children”, she begged.

Her sister offered a pot of stew,

Something to see her through

As the tears flooded down her eyes.

Dawn came with the usual childish squabbles.

Little Jimmy is calling Sarah names

And Michael can’t find his shoes.

“Daddy had an accident” she told them quietly

When they had settled to breakfast.

We’ll go see him in the morning

She prayed to herself - not thinking

Of the unmade bed in their room.



## Lower Me Down Gently
A wake in a grand house with plenty of craic

Who is seeing who and what do you do

I scrubbed tea cups all day

Just to find something to do.

By the wee hours when the drunks left

She sat in her grand living room

Clutching one last cup of tea.

Hoarsely she kept repeating tales of him

How proud and noble he had been

I couldn’t stand the sight of such grief.

When morning came we put on our best

Clothes kept clean for special occasions.

Innocently the children played on the staircase

Not knowing just what had left.

We marched behind the coffin

The whole road diverted.

After a quick repetition of mass,

The usual peace and love bullshit,

I found myself volunteered to hold the ropes -

Something I didn’t know I had the strength for.

So when the last word was said we lowered him down

And tried to say farewell.


## Why I Cry Beneath Pale Moonlight
I see her there now pale goddess of the sky

I know not if she waxes or wanes

A singular point of light in the bleak black sky.

They took me from my home town

And locked me in this dark and haunted castle.

I have not heard my sister’s voice in so long.

She found me manic at home

With eyes that could not slumber.

I dream only of going home,

With no key to my door,

No phone to cry for help.

I am not alone though,

I have found others that share my eyes

And who listen when I speak.



## Forgive Only Yourself
Adults playing at childish games

May lift a stone and cast it forth,

Caring not where it lands.

Who’s head will be next?

Which eye will be blinded?

Next time hang only your own head.

Judgement is reserved for the Divine.



## Kiss Me Goodnight
As we share our final breath

Clutch a dagger by your side

For if the fire were to die

I would drink your blood.

For warmth I would wear your skin,

For food - I don't know what I would do.

I will follow the starlight

Through the decayed ruins

Of madness and despair

And hope to find new light

Over the horizon.



## Cold Steel in Pale Moonlight
When the last stone has fallen

Humanity will be gone.

All hopes, dreams, prayers forgotten.

Some repugnant creature will rise

Feeding on our scattered ashes.

Such strange things they will find.

Noisy boxes flashing in empty chambers,

The lights still on as abandoned windmills

Churn ever on.

Where did these strange creations come from?

Who were these five fingered ancestors?

So brilliant and bold.

What could they see?

Beyond the glittering smoggy blackness

That shrouds this forsaken planet.



## Whisper Evil in my Ear
I can't stand the sight

Of your worried brow.

I'd love to share my delight

Of all the beauty I can see.

I know this fair beast is wounded,

I clutch my fist in anger

Praying that I can save her

But my raging heart

Will only drive her away.



## Last Left Standing in the Cage
They rounded up seven of us

And herded us into a cage.

And though we were burly boys

A hot poker and some dogs

Could force us in.

A crowd had already gathered

Fueled with whiskey and bloodlust.

An officer went round

Announcing odds and taking bets

So the fight could begin.

I had one eye to start with this time

The other I lost a few nights ago.

Still I was the favourite

So all bets were on me.

I am gaunt yet muscular,

Quick and ruthless.

I have managed to sneak a tip

From a wooden kitchen knife and

Clutched carefully in my palm.

When they unleashed us it was all a daze.

Darkness, carnage, anarchy in that cage.

Next time I looked they all laid dead

And I gazed upon what had happened.

In the pile of steaming meat

Was my old cousin Sean.



## Disabled is not a Dirty Word
Dear doctor with the baldy head

I doubt there are any brains in there.

I'd slap that smug look from your face

But it would be the gallows for me.

So I say in as polite a voice as I can,

"I am not sick - I am disabled."

Oh how you furrowed your brow.

Well if I could I'd swipe your scalpel

And perform a live lobotomy

The next time you dare to ask

What the fuck is wrong with ME



## Bet on the Horse with No Name 
Jockeys prepare thy whip

For there's a horse with no name

Riding free today.

The rich shuffle along

In their finest clothes

To the biggest race of the year.

The Grand National they call it -

A fine occasion for champagne.

It's the horses who are in pain

Riding as fast as they can,

Falling with broken legs.

Pray for the horse with no name

Or your name will be on one of the stallions

And your bloodline will be forever

Run ragged along the course.

Bet all your money,

Add a little testosterone to the feed

So that your little steed

Will be able to walk

When the race is run.



## Nothing is New on the News Today
Poor Alice is in chains

And Kurt blew his head off.

Freddie Mercury sings no more

And Diana is not getting a taxi home.

Nothing will ever come back.

Dew drops form on an empty field

While chainsaws rip through the Amazon.

Royal bloodlines still survive

Blood test evidence is provided

Along with the occasional holiday snap.

Young Ginger wouldn't know her mother

It has been decades since she went missing

And was found in an orphanage.



## Forgive Me Not these Cruel Words
Shattering their electric eye

By staring straight back at it.

Fuck the Brits and all

Who conceived this sickening plan.

To monitor all our comings

And observe all our goings.

They silenced our Irish tongue

In the halls of the Christian Brothers.

Nuns strapping helpless boys

Trying to remember their Rosary's

Along with their maths and physics.

Well Alan Turing is smiling now

For he was the the one they conscripted

To weave their wicked webs.

And though he will never be reborn

I shall forever carry

The flame of the wrath

Of his retribution.



## No Answer from the Sun
How we toiled in daylight,

Keeping watch for the lions.

Those we kept became kittens,

So soft and adorable.

By night we heard the howling.

We came to fear the moonlight

For she guided the wolves to us.

Every plant we touched became a poison.

Such boils and blisters we suffered

As we shivered through the night,

Praying each vine was not a python.

Along came a madman

Too dangerous to behold.

In his eyes was murder

And none dared speak his name.

Into the caves he lead us

And instructed to keep only

The sharpest stones and

Most balanced branches.

Go now children! He beckoned.

Surrounded by the mushrooms we gathered

He tasted each one.

Sometimes it was a delight

But once it was nearly his death.

For months he suffered in agony

The spark lost from his eyes.

While we wept by the cave

He remained watchful.

While sharpening our spears

He noticed a brief flash on the walls

As though lightning had struck.


## Ouroboros
Many great minds have decayed

While in hospital chairs.

They spoke of the same serpent

Eating its own tail to survive.

That is what they do to us.

For each day we stay in place

As countless faces pass us by.

Doctors, nurses, visitors all the same.

With new rules and scolding tones.

Some news of the outside world is nice

But it is hard to keep the faith

That anything exists but these walls.



## And Her Face Lit Up for a While
The creature with the dazzling hair,

Spinning and whirling to and fro.

She knew the devil in its eye.

Carefully it treaded between worn out soldiers

And drunkards in a spin.

Cups she laid out for each

Just to come and have a sit.

But we were busy then with our schemes.

It was a sight to behold

So strong and chaotic

Always rattling the cage.

Sweet music it played

Just from its unknown mind.

For a while she knew her youth

And was intoxicated by it.

Eventually the laughs gave way

And silence reigned again.

It has been transferred or beaten

Who knows what it had seen.

Such beautiful poetry lay in a drawer unread.

Just another pile of paper

For the shredder.

She sighed for a long time

And paced to and fro.

Where will they take her

When she can no longer stand?




## The Untouchable Artist
Though I try with every breath

To defeat the darkness everywhere

My art has made me something wretched,

Something nobody can approach.

There's no casual conversation now.

Every word seems to have meaning.

They can't look me in the eye

For they have never seen.


## We Pray Death is the End
How many days will these white walls stand?

What would we even do with the bricks?

Where did the lovely sunshine go?

Or the wind across our face?

I fear there is nothing now.

No replies to my posts.

So I am alone and suffering

Together with the other patients.

How we drive each other mad.

There's no escaping this,

There is nowhere to run.

Hide if you like

But one day you'll find yourself

Surrounded by walls

Alone.



## To Live and Battle
Seductive is the flash of cold steel.

Enthralling are the rallying cries.

To battle! For honour and glory!

To fight is to feel alive

But to win is only hollow.

Someone has to come with a mop

And clean the entrails from the floor.



## When there is Peace
A voice from the East

Whispers in my ear

When I am crying.

They tell me they have eternal life.

Robotics that can replace

Our rotten corpses

While still retaining our soul.

Such beautiful engineering

Would be wasted on a warring world.

Until the last cage is unbolted

They will keep the secret.

For they know our lustful eyes.

We would invade and take it

For ourselves alone.



## Let this Castle Lie to Ruin
Each morning I awake

To the same sickening sight

White walls built so thick

With fences and observation posts.

The same gaunt faces greet me,

"Is it another day?"

Let these walls stand

Unlock all of the doors.

Let them come and see

What you did to me.

For I picked up all the butts

In the smoking area.

I filled the halls with light,

Love, laughter and music.

When I leave here some day

Another shift will start

New punches will be thrown

And new horrors inflicted

Upon innocent disabled patients.

Let this building stand.

May it be our Warsaw.

For how will they ever understand

What has happened here?



## How do you know I am Irish?
We must be a lucky looking folk

For we are known all over.

We don't have brown skin

Or delicate little eyes.

We don't speak some foreign language

We only speak in English.

We're always up for a laugh

A bit of craic whatever that is

And you'd never see us crying

For our tears have already dried.



## Where does the Past Go?
Surely when I flush my toilet

The pipes carry the filth somewhere.

Someone else's job to sort it,

To stand waist high in muck.

Where do my dreams go when I awake?

They seem to just drift away

Faint memories rising to the heavens.

Where does the past go when it is now?

We find ourselves immersed in problems.

Cold stone of jails and wine that has lost its sweet taste.

Our past seems to surround and haunt us all.

The past is nothing but a ghost

Rattling its chains to scare the living.

The only thing that can ever remain

Is this present moment now.


## Suffering the Silenced
My phone no longer rings

Missed calls are all I have.

This silence is deafening.

If I had no tongue I would write

Without arms I would dance

Without legs I could still dream.

If they should cut my eyelids off

I would somehow find slumber.

Still I would dream

That the world would come to me.


## Here all Poets are Doomed to Meet
While halls whirling in a daze

Spinning with anger,

Her deafening howl echoing

Down gloomy white halls.

She ranted and raged all night.

She would slap the smart look from the nurse

But that would bring her somewhere worse.

Another empty hall with gloomy faces.

One colouring a picture

The other ranting about something in the Bible.

What does it matter anyway?

Our looks will fade

And our hearts will cease.

To be surrounded by loved ones

Would bring some relief

But there's not much time for that here

In the white halls where all Poets meet.
